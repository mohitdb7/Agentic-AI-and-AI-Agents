This includes a recent wrongful death lawsuit against OpenAI, which, along with other AI giants, is boosting its lobbying investments and forming Super Political Action Committees. Silicon Valley is reportedly planning a $100m investment in organizations to counteract AI regulations, amidst a rising awareness of AI's potential harms, including lawsuits over its impacts on mental health and youth employment. In related news, a University of Washington study found that individuals' political views could be influenced by the bias of the AI chatbot they interacted with, emphasizing the importance of education about these systems to prevent potential manipulation. Meanwhile, Spotify has tightened its policies on AI music, spam, impersonation, and fraud, leading to the removal of 75 million \"spammy\" tracks from its library. Google Photos has expanded its AI-powered conversational editing feature to all Android devices, enabling users to edit photos via voice or text commands. However, Tesla's Full-Self Driving Software has faced criticism after a test showed the AI system ignoring some street signs and hitting a mannequin child.",
