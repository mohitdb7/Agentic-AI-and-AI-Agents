        "final_summary": "A compilation of AI-related news for the week ending September 21, 2025, curated by ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, and W.H.L., covers developments in news, reality, artificial intelligence, cognition, and machine learning's future, culminating in a \"Best of\" list. Experts emphasize the importance of investing in good data and innovation to mitigate potential \"disasters\" as AI increasingly integrates into aging services, impacting back-office functions, staffing, and patient care. AWM&T Investment Management Team suggests patience and selectivity in Gen AI investments, noting Morgan Stanley's projection of a $1.5 trillion U.S. AI market by 2025 and the prediction of 1.5 million Gen AI jobs in the U.S. by the end of the next decade, contrasting with the U.K.'s stagnant Gen AI job growth. A new book, 'Artificial Intelligence: The Future of War' by Dr. Majid Rafizadeh, published by Oxford University Press and Simon & Schuster, explores AI's transformative potential to advance education, healthcare, and quality of life, while also addressing its capacity to intensify conflicts and raise ethical concerns as a weapon.",

We concluded that *P**atience is warranted as is being selective in investing, but if AI lives up to expectations and enthusiasm, it will generate tremendous value and wealth for companies and investors for years to come. In August, Morgan Stanley reported that the U.S. AI market is expected to reach $1.5 trillion by 2025. The U.K. is the only country in the world that has not seen a rise in the number of jobs created by Gen AI. Morgan Stanley predicts that by the end of the next decade, there will be 1.5 million Gen AI jobs in the United States."
