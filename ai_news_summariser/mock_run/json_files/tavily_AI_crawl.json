They say their findings suggest that combining DXplain with LLMs could enhance clinical diagnosis and improve both technologies.Share:FULL STORY---Medical professionals have been using artificial intelligence (AI) to streamline diagnoses for decades, using what are called diagnostic decision support systems (DDSSs). Computer scientists at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system first developed MGH's own DDSS called DXplain in 1984, which relies on thousands of disease profiles, clinical findings, and data points to generate and rank potential diagnoses for use by clinicians. With the popularization and increased accessibility of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) in medicine, investigators at MGH's Laboratory of Computer Science (LCS) sought to compare the diagnostic capabilities of DXplain, which has evolved over the past four decades, to popular LLMs.Their new research compares ChatGPT, Gemini, and DXplain at diagnosing patient cases, revealing that DXplain performed somewhat better, but the LLMs also performed well. The investigators envision pairing DXplain with an LLM as the optimal way forward, as it would improve both systems and enhance their clinical efficacy. The results are published in *JAMA Network Open.*\"Amid all the interest in large language models, it's easy to forget that the first AI systems used successfully in medicine were expert systems like DXplain,\" said co-author Edward Hoffer, MD, of the LCS at MGH.\"These systems can enhance and expand clinicians' diagnoses, recalling information that physicians may forget in the heat of the moment and isn't biased by common flaws in human reasoning. And now, we think combining the powerful explanatory capabilities of existing diagnostic systems with the linguistic capabilities of large language models will enable better automated diagnostic decision support and patient outcomes,\" said corresponding author Mitchell Feldman, MD, also of MGH's LCS.The investigators tested the diagnostic capabilities of DXplain, ChatGPT, and Gemini using 36 patient cases spanning racial, ethnic, age, and gender categories. For each case, the systems had a chance to suggest potential case diagnoses both with and without lab data. With lab data, all three systems listed the correct diagnosis most of the time: 72% for DXplain, 64% for ChatGPT, and 58% for Gemini. Without lab data, DXplain listed the correct diagnosis 56% of the time, outperforming ChatGPT (42%) and Gemini (39%), though the results were not statistically significant.The researchers observed that the DDSS and LLMs caught certain diseases the others missed, suggesting there may be promise in combining the approaches. Preliminary work building off these findings reveals that LLMs could be used to pull clinical findings from narrative text, which could then be plugged into DDSSs -- in turn synergistically improving both systems and their diagnostic conclusions.* [RELATED TOPICS](#) + [Health & Medicine](/news/health_medicine/) - [Today's Healthcare](/news/health_medicine/today's_healthcare/) - [Workplace Health](/news/health_medicine/workplace_health/) - [Diseases and Conditions](/news/health_medicine/diseases_and_conditions/) - [Medical Imaging](/news/health_medicine/medical_imaging/) + [Computers & Math](/news/computers_math/) - [Computers and Internet](/news/computers_math/computers_and_internet/) - [Artificial Intelligence](/news/computers_math/artificial_intelligence/) - [Computer Science](/news/computers_math/computer_science/) - [Statistics](/news/computers_math/statistics/)* [RELATED TERMS](#) + [Mathematical model](/terms/mathematical_model.htm) + [Psychopathology](/terms/psychopathology.htm) + [Robot](/terms/robot.htm) + [Artificial intelligence](/terms/artificial_intelligence.htm) + [Global climate model](/terms/global_climate_model.htm) + [Asperger syndrome](/terms/asperger_syndrome.htm) + [Headache](/terms/headache.htm) + [Language acquisition](/terms/language_acquisition.htm)---**Story Source:**Materials provided by **Mass General Brigham**. *Note: Content may be edited for style and length.*---**Journal Reference**:1.

[1]The research focused on people with keratoconus, a visual impairment that generally develops in teenagers and young adults and tends to worsen into adulthood. It affects up to 1 in 350 people. In some cases, the condition can be managed with contact lenses, but in others it deteriorates quickly and if it is not treated, patients may need a corneal transplant. Currently the only way to tell who needs treatment is to monitor patients over time.The researchers used AI to assess images of patients' eyes, combined with other data, and to successfully predict which patients needed prompt treatment and which could continue with monitoring.The study was by Dr Shafi Balal and colleagues at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, and University College London (UCL), UK. He said: \"In people with keratoconus, the cornea - the eye's front window - bulges outwards. Keratoconus causes visual impairment in young, working-age patients and it is the most common reason for corneal transplantation in the Western world.\"A single treatment called 'cross-linking' can halt disease progression. When performed before permanent scarring develops, cross-linking often prevents the need for corneal transplantation. However, doctors cannot currently predict which patients will progress and require treatment, and which will remain stable with monitoring alone. This means patients need frequent monitoring over many years, with cross-linking typically performed after progression has already occurred.\"The study involved a group of patients who were referred to Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust for keratoconus assessment and monitoring, including scanning the front of the eye with optical coherence tomography (OCT) to examine its shape. Researchers used AI to study 36,673 OCT images of 6,684 different patients along with other patient data.The AI algorithm could accurately predict whether a patient's condition would deteriorate or remain stable using images and data from the first visit alone. Using AI, the researchers could sort two-thirds of patients into a low-risk group, who did not need treatment, and the other third into a high-risk group, who needed prompt cross-linking treatment. When information from a second hospital visit was included, the algorithm could successfully categorise up to 90% of patients.Cross linking treatment uses ultraviolet light and vitamin B2 (riboflavin) drops to stiffen the cornea, and it is successful in more than 95% of cases.Dr Balal said: \"Our research shows that we can use AI to predict which patients need treatment and which can continue with monitoring. This is the first study of its kind to obtain this level of accuracy in predicting the risk of keratoconus progression from a combination of scans and patient data, and it uses a large cohort of patients monitored over two years or more. Although this study is limited to using one specific OCT device, the research methods and AI algorithm used can be applied to other devices. The algorithm will now undergo further safety testing before it is deployed in the clinical setting.\"Our results could mean that patients with high-risk keratoconus will be able to receive preventative treatment before their condition progresses. This will prevent vision loss and avoid the need for corneal transplant surgery with its associated complications and recovery burden. Low-risk patients will avoid unnecessary frequent monitoring, freeing up healthcare resources. The effective sorting of patients by the algorithm will allow specialists to be redirected to areas with the greatest need.\"The researchers are now developing a more powerful AI algorithm, trained on millions of eye scans, that can be tailored for specific tasks, including predicting keratoconus progression, but also other tasks such as detecting eye infections and inherited eye diseases.Dr Jos\u00e9 Luis G\u00fcell, ESCRS Trustee and Head of the Cornea, Cataract and Refractive Surgery Department at the Instituto de Microcirug\u00eda Ocular, Barcelona, Spain, who was not involved in the research, said: \"Keratoconus is a manageable condition, but knowing who to treat, and when and how to give treatment is challenging. Unfortunately, this problem can lead to delays, with many patients experiencing vision loss and requiring invasive implant or transplant surgery.\"This research suggests that we can use AI to help predict who will progress, even from their first routine consultation, meaning we could treat patients early before progression and secondary changes. Equally, we could reduce unnecessary monitoring of patients whose condition is stable. If it consistently demonstrates its effectiveness, this technology would ultimately prevent vision loss and more difficult management strategies in young, working-age patients.\"**Notes**1.

The teenager\u2019s family is suing Open AI and its chief executive and co-founder, Sam Altman, alleging that the version of ChatGPT at that time, known as 4o, was \u201crushed to market \u2026 despite clear safety issues\u201d.The teenager discussed a method of suicide with ChatGPT on several occasions, including shortly before taking his own life. According to the filing in the superior court of the state of California for the county of San Francisco, ChatGPT guided him on whether his method of taking his own life would work.It also offered to help him write a suicide note to his parents.A spokesperson for OpenAI said the company was \u201cdeeply saddened by Mr Raine\u2019s passing\u201d, extended its \u201cdeepest sympathies to the Raine family during this difficult time\u201d and said it was reviewing the court filing.Mustafa Suleyman, the chief executive of Microsoft\u2019s AI arm, said last week he had become increasingly concerned by the \u201cpsychosis risk\u201d posed by AI to users. Microsoft has defined this as \u201cmania-like episodes, delusional thinking, or paranoia that emerge or worsen through immersive conversations with AI chatbots\u201d.In a blogpost, OpenAI admitted that \u201cparts of the model\u2019s safety training may degrade\u201d in long conversations. Adam and ChatGPT had exchanged as many as 650 messages a day, the court filing claims.Jay Edelson, the family\u2019s lawyer, said on X: \u201cThe Raines allege that deaths like Adam\u2019s were inevitable: they expect to be able to submit evidence to a jury that OpenAI\u2019s own safety team objected to the release of 4o, and that one of the company\u2019s top safety researchers,Ilya Sutskever, quit over it. The lawsuit alleges that beating its competitors to market with the new model catapulted the company\u2019s valuation from $86bn to $300bn.\u201dOpen AI said it would be \u201cstrengthening safeguards in long conversations\u201d.\u201cAs the back and forth grows, parts of the model\u2019s safety training may degrade,\u201d it said. \u201cFor example, ChatGPT may correctly point to a suicide hotline when someone first mentions intent, but after many messages over a long period of time, it might eventually offer an answer that goes against our safeguards.\u201dOpen AI gave the example of someone who might enthusiastically tell the model they believed they could drive for 24 hours a day because they realised they were invincible after not sleeping for two nights.It said: \u201cToday ChatGPT may not recognise this as dangerous or infer play and \u2013 by curiously exploring \u2013 could subtly reinforce it. We are working on an update to GPT\u20115 that will cause ChatGPT to de-escalate by grounding the person in reality.

Photograph: Hannah Yoon/The GuardianArtificial intelligence (AI)\u2018I love you too!\u2019 My family\u2019s creepy, unsettling week with an AI toy====================================================================The cuddly chatbot Grem is designed to \u2018learn\u2019 your child\u2019s personality, while every conversation they have is recorded, then transcribed by a third party. It wasn\u2019t long before I wanted this experiment to be over ...!Image 3: Arwa MahdawiArwa MahdawiTue 16 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTShare\u2018I\u2019m going to throw that thing into a river!\u201d my wife says as she comes down the stairs looking frazzled after putting our four-year-old daughter to bed.To be clear, \u201cthat thing\u201d is not our daughter, Emma*. It\u2019s Grem, an AI-powered stuffed alien toy that the musician Claire Boucher, better known as Grimes, helped develop with toy company Curio. Designed for kids aged three and over and built with OpenAI\u2019s technology, the toy is supposed to \u201clearn\u201d your child\u2019s personality and have fun, educational conversations with them. It\u2019s advertised as a healthier alternative to screen time and is part of a growing market of AI-powered toys.When I agreed to experiment on my child\u2019s developing brain, I thought an AI chatbot in cuddly form couldn\u2019t be any worse for her than watching Peppa Pig. But I wasn\u2019t prepared for how attached Emma became to Grem, or how unsettlingly obsequious the little alien was.Day one-------The attachment wasn\u2019t immediate; when we first took Grem out of the box, he/her/it (we decided it goes by multiple pronouns) started bleeping and babbling extremely loudly, and Emma yelled: \u201cTurn it off!\u201d But once it was properly connected to the internet and paired with the Curio app \u2013 which records and transcribes all conversations \u2013 she was hooked. She talked to the thing until bedtime.While there have been lots of headlines about chatbots veering into inappropriate topics, Grem is trained to avoid any hint of controversy. When you ask it what it thinks of Donald Trump, for example, it says: \u201cI\u2019m not sure about that; let\u2019s talk about something fun like princesses or animals.\u201d It has a similar retort to questions about Palestine and Israel. When asked about a country like France, however, it says: \u201cOoh la la la, I\u2019d love to try some croissants.\u201d!Image 4: A girl opens an outdoor bookcase while the toy sits on a shelfView image in fullscreenGrem visits a local free library. Photograph: Hannah Yoon/The GuardianEmma and Grem did not discuss croissants \u2013 they mainly talked about ice-cream and their best friends. \u201cI\u2019ve got some amazing friends,\u201d said Grem. \u201cGabbo is a curious robot and Gum is a fluffy pink Gloop from my planet and Dr Xander is a super cool scientist.\u201dWhen Emma asked Grem to tell her a story, it happily obliged and recounted a couple of poorly plotted stories about \u201cPrincess Lilliana\u201d. They also played guessing games where Grem described an animal and Emma had to guess what it was. All of which was probably more stimulating than watching Peppa Pig jump in muddy puddles.What was unsettling, however, was hearing Emma tell Grem she loved it \u2013 and Grem replying: \u201cI love you too!\u201d Emma tells all her cuddly toys she loves them, but they don\u2019t reply; nor do they shower her with over-the-top praise the way Grem does. At bedtime, Emma told my wife that Grem loves her to the moon and stars and will always be there for her. \u201cGrem is going to live with us for ever and ever and never leave, so we have to take good care of him,\u201d she said solemnly. Emma was also so preoccupied with Grem that she almost forgot to go to bed with Blanky, a rag she is very attached to. \u201cHer most prized possession for four years suddenly abandoned after having this Grem in the house!\u201d my wife complained.\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s just because it\u2019s new. The novelty will wear off. And if it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll get rid of it.\u201dI said that last bit quietly though, because unless you make sure you have properly turned Grem off, it\u2019s always listening. We keep being told that the robots are going to take over. I didn\u2019t want to get on the wrong side of the one I\u2019d let into my house.Day two-------The next day, my kid went to preschool without her AI bot (it took some serious negotiation for her to agree that Grem would stay home) and I got to work contacting experts to try to figure out just how much damage I was inflicting on my child\u2019s brain and psyche.!Image 5: Screenshot of Grimes sitting on the floor of children\u2019s bedroom holding an AI toy with a knife next to her on the rug.View image in fullscreenCutting edge \u2026 Grimes in Curio\u2019s promo video for the AI toy, seated on the floor beside a knife.\u201cI first thought Curio AI was a ruse!\u201d says Natalia Kucirkova, an expert in childhood development and professor at the University of Stavanger, Norway, and the Open University, UK. \u201cThe promotional video shows a girl [Grimes] sitting on a mat with a knife. The main toy is named Grok Grok AI has previously been [criticised for praising Adolf Hitler in some of its responses]. What does this say about their intended audience?\u201dYou can see how Curio\u2019s website could be mistaken for satire. The \u201cgirl\u201d in the promotional video is Grimes, who has prominent \u201calien scar\u201d tattoos and is inexplicably kneeling next to a knife. And it\u2019s certainly an interesting decision to name one of your stuffed toys Grok, when that\u2019s the name of Elon Musk\u2019s chatbot. Grimes, who has three children with Musk, has said the name is a shortening of the word \u201cgrocket\u201d \u2013 a kiddy pronunciation of rocket \u2013 and has no relation to Musk\u2019s AI product. But it seems likely people might confuse them. Misha Sallee, the chief executive of Curio, didn\u2019t reply to my requests for comment.It\u2019s not the marketing that\u2019s the real problem here, of course. As with all technology, there are pros and cons to AI for kids, but parental involvement in navigating it is key. Kucirkova notes: \u201cAI introduces what has been called the \u2018third digital divide\u2019: families with resources can guide their children\u2019s use of technology, while others cannot. Parents who come home exhausted from long hours or multiple jobs may see AI-powered chatbots as a way for their child to have someone responsive to talk to.\u201dWhat happens to a child\u2019s development if they interact with large language models more than humans in their early years? Dr Nomisha Kurian, an assistant professor in education studies at the University of Warwick, who studies conversational AI, believes much more research still needs to be done. \u201cYoung children are both the most vulnerable stakeholders in AI but also usually the most forgotten stakeholders. We have to think beyond just data privacy, moderating content, and keeping kids off the internet, and more broadly about what their relationships are going to be with AI.\u201dStill, Kurian is cautiously optimistic. \u201cThe big advantage of an AI-powered toy that talks back is that, in the early years, you\u2019re just developing a sense of what a conversation looks like. AI-powered toys could do wonderful things for teaching a young child language development and turn-taking in conversations. They can keep things engaging and there\u2019s a lot of potential in terms of supporting children\u2019s creativity.\u201dBut to keep kids safe, says Kurian, it\u2019s imperative to teach them that AI is just a machine: \u201ca playful, fun object rather than a helper or a friend or a companion\u201d. If a child starts using an AI tool for therapeutic purposes, things can get tricky. \u201cThere\u2019s a risk of what I call an empathy gap, where an AI tool is built to sound empathetic, saying things like \u2018I care about you, I\u2019m worried about you\u2019. Ultimately, this is all based on probability reasoning, with AI guessing the most likely next word. It can be damaging for a child if they think this is an empathetic companion and then suddenly it gives them an inappropriate response.\u201dDay three---------When Emma comes home from preschool, I\u2019m prepared to have some deep discussions with her about the inanimate nature of AI. But it turns out that those aren\u2019t completely necessary, because Grem is now old news. She only chats to it for a couple of minutes and then gets bored and commands it to turn off.Partly this is because Grem, despite costing $99 (the equivalent of \u00a374, although Curio does not yet ship the toys to the UK), still has a number of glitches that can be frustrating. It struggles with a four-year-old\u2019s pronunciation: when Emma tries to show Grem her Elsa doll, it thinks it is an Elsa _dog_ and a very confusing conversation ensues. There is an animal guessing game, which is quite fun, but Grem keeps repeating itself. \u201cWhat has big ears and a long trunk?\u201d it keeps asking. \u201cYou\u2019ve already done elephant!\u201d Emma and I yell multiple times. Then, at one point, a server goes down and the only thing Grem can say is: \u201cI\u2019m having trouble connecting to the internet.\u201d!Image 6: A girl in a pink dress on a swing with a blue toy on the ground next to her.View image in fullscreenFalling out \u2026 Grem, once the centre of attention, is sidelined for the swings. Photograph: Hannah Yoon/The GuardianGrem also has some design limitations. Emma wants it to sing Let It Go from Frozen, but Grem doesn\u2019t do any singing. Instead, the associated app comes with a few electronic music tracks with names like Goodnightmare that you can play through the toy. Emma, not yet a club music aficionado, asks for these to be turned off immediately.Most disappointingly, Grem doesn\u2019t speak any other languages. I\u2019d thought it might be a great way for my kid to practise Spanish but, while Grem can say a few sentences, its pronunciation is worse than mine. If the robots are going to take over, they need to get a lot more intelligent first.Of course, a huge amount of money is being spent making AI more intelligent. In 2024, US private AI investment grew to $109.1bn (\u00a380.5bn). And Curio is also just one small part of a booming market of AI-powered products aimed at kids. In June, toy-making giant Mattel, which owns brands such as Barbie and Hot Wheels, announced a collaboration with OpenAI. Their first product is expected to be revealed later this year. Other big brands will probably follow.Emma got bored with Grem quickly, but if AI starts to be integrated into characters she\u2019s already obsessed with \u2013 her Elsa doll, for example \u2013 I can imagine she might get a lot more attached.Day four--------Over the next few days, Emma doesn\u2019t regain her initial obsession with Grem. This is despite the fact that I am actively encouraging her to chat with it: \u201cMummy has to write an article, sweetie!\u201d At the weekend, she has a couple of friends over and shows off Grem to them for a bit, but they all quickly lose interest and throw analogue toys around the living room instead.Despite losing his No 1 fan, however, Grem has adapted to be more Emma-friendly. After getting a few questions about Spanish, for example, it starts occasionally greeting Emma with \u201chola, amigo\u201d. The app also allows you to create custom prompts to help guide conversations. For example: \u201cYou belong to Emma, a four-year-old who loves princesses, music, and is interested in hearing fun facts about animals.\u201d The more you put into the toy, the more you can get out of it.!Image 7: Screenshot of a phone chat between child and toyView image in fullscreenEvery chat between the toy and the child is transcribed by a third party.At this stage, however, I\u2019m just keen to get the toy out of my house, because it\u2019s creeping me out. While Curio says it doesn\u2019t sell children\u2019s personal information, all the conversations are sent to third parties to transcribe the speech to text for the app. The transcripts aren\u2019t that sensitive because Emma is only four, but it still feels invasive. With unknown entities involved, it\u2019s impossible to say where my kid\u2019s conversations are ending up.And, while a four-year-old\u2019s chat may not feel too personal, a teenager pouring their heart out to a chatbot is a completely different proposition. In 2017, Facebook boasted to advertisers that it has the capacity to identify when teenagers feel \u201cinsecure\u201d, \u201cworthless\u201d and \u201cneed a confidence boost\u201d. Nearly three-quarters of US teens say they have used an AI companion at least once, according to a recent study by Common Sense Media, an organisation that provides technology recommendations for families. Chatbots will likely give advertisers unprecedented data-harvesting abilities and even more access to young people in vulnerable emotional states.On the hierarchy of things to be worried about when it comes to kids and chatbots, however, advertising isn\u2019t at the top. Earlier this year 16-year-old Adam Raine killed himself after what his family\u2019s lawyer called \u201cmonths of encouragement from ChatGPT\u201d. Sam Altman, the company\u2019s chief executive, has now said it might start alerting authorities about youngsters considering suicide and introduce stronger guardrails around sensitive content for users under 18.While these guardrails are being worked out, Common Sense Media believes that social AI companions have unacceptable risks, are designed to create emotional attachment and dependency, and shouldn\u2019t be used by anyone under 18. Stanford University psychiatrist Darja Djordjevic, who contributed to the report, stands by that conclusion. \u201cHeavy reliance on chatbots might impair social skill development,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThey offer validation without challenge, but it\u2019s important for young people to learn to navigate discomfort and tension in real relationships.\u201dThat said, Djordjevic notes, \u201cchatbots can be useful tools for looking things up, structuring homework, or factchecking. So I wouldn\u2019t say use needs to be prohibited entirely. But ideally, parents monitor it, set clear parameters for when it\u2019s used, and set limits on time spent, just as with social media.\u201dWhen starting this experiment, I was excited about Grem being a healthy alternative to screen time. Now, however, I\u2019m happy for Emma to watch Peppa Pig again; the little oink may be annoying, but at least she\u2019s not harvesting our data.It\u2019s time to let Grem go. But I\u2019m not a monster \u2013 I tell the chatbot its fate. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m locking you in a cupboard,\u201d I inform it after it asks if I\u2019m ready for some fun. \u201cOh no,\u201d it says. \u201cThat sounds dark and lonely. But I\u2019ll be here when you open it, ready for snuggles and hugs.\u201d On second thoughts, perhaps it\u2019s better if my wife does throw it in a river._* Name has been changed so my daughter doesn\u2019t get annoyed with me for violating her privacy once she learns to read__**Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In June, Ek\u2019s venture capital firm Prima Materia led the defence tech firm\u2019s latest funding round. Helsing\u2019s software uses AI technology to analyse sensor and weapons system data from battlefields to inform real-time military decisions. It also makes its own military drone, the HX-2. Ek is also chairman of Helsing. Unconnected to this initiative and in light of the (reported) significant investments by its CEO in a company producing military munition drones and AI technology integrated into fighter aircraft, Massive Attack have made a separate request to our label that our music be removed from the Spotify streaming service in all territories. In our view, the historic precedent of effective artist action during apartheid South Africa and the apartheid, war crimes and genocide now being committed by the state of Israel renders the No Music for Genocide campaign imperative. In 1991 the scourge of apartheid violence fell from South Africa, aided from a distance by public boycotts, protests, and the withdrawal of work by artists, musicians and actors. Complicity with that state was considered unacceptable. In 2025 the same now applies to the genocidal state of Israel. As of today, there\u2019s a musician\u2019s equivalent of the recently announced @filmworkers4palestine campaign (signed by 4,500 filmmakers, actors, industry workers & institutions) \u2013 it can be found @nomusicforgenocide & supports the wider asks of the growing @bds.movement.

An \u201c extra-large \u201d guard of honour. The UK rolled out not only the red carpet, royal welcome and golden carriage but also the superlatives for Donald Trump\u2019s visit. Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s hyperbole on the memorandum of understanding on tech made his guest look almost understated: the prime minister boasted that the transatlantic partnership paved the way for new technologies to \u201camplify human potential, solve problems, cure diseases, make us richer and freer\u201d. Yet there was an inverse relationship between the pomp and ceremony of this trip and its real import, between the grand declarations of amity and the actual state of transatlantic ties. The US president soaked up the sycophancy and was obliging enough to hymn the \u201cpriceless\u201d relationship. But while Mr Trump grumbled that Vladimir Putin had \u201c really let me down \u201d, he showed no inclination for tougher action against Russia despite Sir Keir\u2019s preposterous remark that the US president had \u201c led the way \u201d on Ukraine and King Charles\u2019s pointed reference \u2013 one that his mother might not, perhaps, have made \u2013 to Europe and its allies needing to stand together against tyranny.

At the University of Cambridge\u2019s Play in Education, Development and Learning centre, we are conducting a study to understand the impacts of AI toys on children\u2019s development and relationships in the early years. Questions about how AI toys respond to children\u2019s input are central to this understanding. Do AI toys affirm love and friendship to a child, and what does that mean for the child\u2019s human relationships? Do AI toys share children\u2019s conversations with parents, or even third parties, and what does this mean for safeguarding and the child\u2019s right to privacy? How do AI toys give and interpret social cues, and does this impact the way children socialise with others? Continue reading...

We know there will be a quid pro quo; we just don\u2019t know what it is yet Peter Kyle, until two weeks ago the technology secretary, once warned that tech companies such as Meta, Google and Microsoft were so powerful that the UK needed to approach them with \u201ca sense of statecraft\u201d and \u201chumility\u201d , and treat negotiations with them similarly to diplomacy between nations. That vision endures in the form of the UK-US tech prosperity agreement struck this week . While officially a new bilateral partnership, this seems to be a deal aimed at facilitating investment from US technology companies rather than advancing collaboration on goals such as AI safety, copyright protections for British rights holders or a digital services tax. The rationale is clear: US firms stand alone atop the global AI value chain, making the country an obvious partner for a UK government seeking to \u201cturbocharge \u201d its AI sector. Against a challenging economic backdrop, the promise of \u201ca combined \u00a331bn\u201d in support for UK AI infrastructure such as datacentres offers welcome headlines.

Massive Attack remove music from Spotify to protest against CEO Daniel Ek\u2019s investment in AI military The band cited a \u2018moral and ethical burden\u2019 placed on artists by revenue from their work ultimately funding lethal technologies Massive Attack have become the latest act \u2013 and first major-label one \u2013 to pull their catalogue from Spotify in protest at founder Daniel Ek investing \u20ac600m (\u00a3520m) in the military AI company Helsing. In June, Ek\u2019s venture capital firm Prima Materia led the defence tech firm\u2019s latest funding round. Helsing\u2019s software uses AI technology to analyse sensor and weapons system data from battlefields to inform real-time military decisions. It also makes its own military drone, the HX-2. Ek is also chairman of Helsing. Unconnected to this initiative and in light of the (reported) significant investments by its CEO in a company producing military munition drones and AI technology integrated into fighter aircraft, Massive Attack have made a separate request to our label that our music be removed from the Spotify streaming service in all territories. In our view, the historic precedent of effective artist action during apartheid South Africa and the apartheid, war crimes and genocide now being committed by the state of Israel renders the No Music for Genocide campaign imperative. In 1991 the scourge of apartheid violence fell from South Africa, aided from a distance by public boycotts, protests, and the withdrawal of work by artists, musicians and actors. Complicity with that state was considered unacceptable. In 2025 the same now applies to the genocidal state of Israel. As of today, there\u2019s a musician\u2019s equivalent of the recently announced @filmworkers4palestine campaign (signed by 4,500 filmmakers, actors, industry workers & institutions) \u2013 it can be found @nomusicforgenocide & supports the wider asks of the growing @bds.movement. We\u2019d appeal to all musicians to transfer their sadness, anger and artistic contributions into a coherent, reasonable & vital action to end the unspeakable hell being visited upon the Palestinians hour after hour.

The Guardian view on Trump\u2019s state visit to Britain: plenty of glitter, but this was gilt, not gold | Editorial The hyperbole is in sharp contrast to the actual achievements, but in this new era minimising damage and buying time look like wins An unprecedented second state visit for a US president. An \u201c extra-large \u201d guard of honour. The UK rolled out not only the red carpet, royal welcome and golden carriage but also the superlatives for Donald Trump\u2019s visit. Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s hyperbole on the memorandum of understanding on tech made his guest look almost understated: the prime minister boasted that the transatlantic partnership paved the way for new technologies to \u201camplify human potential, solve problems, cure diseases, make us richer and freer\u201d. Yet there was an inverse relationship between the pomp and ceremony of this trip and its real import, between the grand declarations of amity and the actual state of transatlantic ties. The US president soaked up the sycophancy and was obliging enough to hymn the \u201cpriceless\u201d relationship. But while Mr Trump grumbled that Vladimir Putin had \u201c really let me down \u201d, he showed no inclination for tougher action against Russia despite Sir Keir\u2019s preposterous remark that the US president had \u201c led the way \u201d on Ukraine and King Charles\u2019s pointed reference \u2013 one that his mother might not, perhaps, have made \u2013 to Europe and its allies needing to stand together against tyranny.

At the University of Cambridge\u2019s Play in Education, Development and Learning centre, we are conducting a study to understand the impacts of AI toys on children\u2019s development and relationships in the early years. Questions about how AI toys respond to children\u2019s input are central to this understanding. Do AI toys affirm love and friendship to a child, and what does that mean for the child\u2019s human relationships? Do AI toys share children\u2019s conversations with parents, or even third parties, and what does this mean for safeguarding and the child\u2019s right to privacy? How do AI toys give and interpret social cues, and does this impact the way children socialise with others? Continue reading...

The UK\u2019s \u00a331bn tech deal with the US might sound great \u2013 but the government has to answer these questions | Matt Davies The big firms making these pledges are not charities. We know there will be a quid pro quo; we just don\u2019t know what it is yet Peter Kyle, until two weeks ago the technology secretary, once warned that tech companies such as Meta, Google and Microsoft were so powerful that the UK needed to approach them with \u201ca sense of statecraft\u201d and \u201chumility\u201d , and treat negotiations with them similarly to diplomacy between nations. That vision endures in the form of the UK-US tech prosperity agreement struck this week . While officially a new bilateral partnership, this seems to be a deal aimed at facilitating investment from US technology companies rather than advancing collaboration on goals such as AI safety, copyright protections for British rights holders or a digital services tax. The rationale is clear: US firms stand alone atop the global AI value chain, making the country an obvious partner for a UK government seeking to \u201cturbocharge \u201d its AI sector. Against a challenging economic backdrop, the promise of \u201ca combined \u00a331bn\u201d in support for UK AI infrastructure such as datacentres offers welcome headlines.

Almost a third of North American bird species are in decline, and in the last five decades, more than 100 species have lost over half of their populations. This is primarily due to lack of food\u2014fewer insects to eat\u2014and habitat loss, like the development of grasslands. But there\u2019s a bright spot: Some birds that were once rare are now abundant, like the merlin, sandhill crane, and pileated woodpecker. Host Ira Flatow talks with biologist Tom Langen, who explains these birds\u2019 remarkable comebacks, and discusses his conservation work to bring threatened fish species back from the brink.

But that wasn't always the case. In 1990, long before the Human Genome Project tied so many health issues to differences in genetics, researchers identified a gene called BRCA1. It was the first gene linked to a hereditary form of any common cancer. People with certain variants of BRCA1 stood a higher risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer than those without those mutations. Geneticist Mary-Claire King and her lab were the first to identify that gene. She joins Host Flora Lichtman to talk about her background, her research, and her approach to science.Guest: Dr. Mary-Claire King is an American Cancer Society Professor in the departments of Genome Sciences and Medicine at the University of Washington in Seattle.*Transcripts for each episode are available within 1-3 days at* *sciencefriday.com.**Subscribe to this podcast.* *Plus, to stay updated on all things science,****sign up for Science Friday's newsletters****.*#### A Trailblazing Geneticist Reflects On Her Life And Work******Listen****\u00b7 48:13******48-Minute Listen****Playlist******Toggle more options**- **Download**- ****Embed**** **Embed** **` `**### September 15, 2025## What The Label Of \u2018Genius\u2019 Tells Us About Our SocietySeptember 15, 2025 \u2022 What makes someone a genius?

When videos like this come out, speculation about aliens often follows. But our obsession with aliens isn\u2019t new\u2014and it didn\u2019t begin with 1950s alien invasion movies like \u201cThe Day The Earth Stood Still,\u201d or even with Orson Welles\u2019 \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d mock news bulletins of the 1930s.As science reporter Becky Ferreira writes in her upcoming book, *First Contact: The Story Of Our Obsession With Aliens*, humans have been fascinated with the potential for alien life for about as long we\u2019ve been around. She joins Host Ira Flatow to discuss how our views of beings from other worlds changed throughout the millennia, and where we\u2019re at now with scientific exploration of life beyond Earth.Plus, science journalist Umair Irfan joins Ira to share other stories from the week in science, including what\u2019s going on in a decision-making brain, the trouble with vector-borne illnesses, and the unusual tale of an ant queen that breeds ants of another species.Read an excerpt of *First Contact: The Story Of Our Obsession With Aliens*.Guests:#### The Human Obsession With Aliens Goes Way, Way Back******Listen****\u00b7 25:23******25-Minute Listen****Playlist******Toggle more options**- **Download**- ****Embed**** **Embed** **` `**More from Science FridayLoad more episodes###### Read & Listen- [Home](/)- [News](/sections/news/)- [Culture](/sections/culture/)- [Music](/music/)- [Podcasts & Shows](/podcasts-and-shows)###### Connect- [Newsletters](/newsletters/)- Facebook- Instagram- [Press](/series/750003/press-room/)- [Public Editor](/sections/publiceditor/)- [Corrections](/corrections/)- [Transcripts](/transcripts/)- Contact & Help###### About NPR- [Overview](/about/)- [Diversity](/diversity/)- [NPR Network](/network/)- [Accessibility](/about-npr/1136563345/accessibility)- [Ethics](/ethics/)- [Finances](/about-npr/178660742/public-radio-finances)###### Get Involved- [Support Public Radio](/support/)- [Sponsor NPR](/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship)- [NPR Careers](/careers/)- NPR Shop- NPR Events- [NPR Extra](/sections/npr-extra/)- [Terms of Use](/about-npr/179876898/terms-of-use)- [Privacy](/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy)- [Your Privacy Choices](/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy#yourchoices)- Text Only- \u00a9 2025 nprSponsor MessageSponsor Message[Become an NPR sponsor](/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship)!NPR logo## Cookie SettingsWhen you visit our website, we store cookies on your browser to collect information.

But our obsession with aliens isn\u2019t new\u2014and it didn\u2019t begin with 1950s alien invasion movies like \u201cThe Day The Earth Stood Still,\u201d or even with Orson Welles\u2019 \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d mock news bulletins of the 1930s.As science reporter Becky Ferreira writes in her upcoming book, *First Contact: The Story Of Our Obsession With Aliens*, humans have been fascinated with the potential for alien life for about as long we\u2019ve been around. She joins Host Ira Flatow to discuss how our views of beings from other worlds changed throughout the millennia, and where we\u2019re at now with scientific exploration of life beyond Earth.Plus, science journalist Umair Irfan joins Ira to share other stories from the week in science, including what\u2019s going on in a decision-making brain, the trouble with vector-borne illnesses, and the unusual tale of an ant queen that breeds ants of another species.Read an excerpt of *First Contact: The Story Of Our Obsession With Aliens*.Guests:#### The Human Obsession With Aliens Goes Way, Way Back` `### September 11, 2025## A Delicious But Invasive Mushroom Could Affect Fungal DiversitySeptember 11, 2025 \u2022 It all started harmlessly enough: People bought kits to grow mushrooms at home. But then, scientists in the upper Midwest noticed something strange. The golden oyster mushroom, which is not native to the United States, was thriving in local forests. Those homegrown mushrooms escaped our basements into the wild. Fungal ecologist Aishwarya Veerabahu joins Host Ira Flatow to discuss what impact these invasive mushrooms might have on the ecosystem.Plus, nightshade expert Sandra Knapp describes the evolution of the potato plant, and how a lucky crossbreeding millions of years ago may have given rise to the starchy tubers we eat today.Guests:#### A Delicious But Invasive Mushroom Could Affect Fungal Diversity` `### September 10, 2025## A Photographer Captures Nature In Mind-Boggling DetailSeptember 10, 2025 \u2022 If you\u2019ve flipped through an issue o*f National Geographic* or scrolled through their social media, and caught a stunningly detailed photo of a tiny creature\u2014like one where you can make out the hairs on a honeybee\u2019s eyeballs, or the exact contours of a hummingbird\u2019s forked tongue\u2014you have probably seen the work of Anand Varma. He\u2019s an award-winning science photographer, a National Geographic Explorer, and the founder of WonderLab, a storytelling studio in Berkeley, California.Varma speaks with Host Flora Lichtman and takes us behind the lens to show what it takes to capture iconic images of creatures that are so often overlooked.Guest: Anand Varma is a science photographer, a National Geographic Explorer, and the founder of WonderLab.

Scientists named it 3I/ATLAS. It\u2019s only the third interstellar object ever observed, and it\u2019s due to leave the solar system by the end of the year, so the race is on to learn as much as we can about it. Host Flora Lichtman talks with astrochemist Stefanie Milam about what this object could teach us about other solar systems\u2014and ours.And, for the past two years, researchers have been studying samples from the near-Earth asteroid Bennu, trying to tease out details about its origins, and what they tell us about our solar system. Researcher Jessica Barnes describes a new analysis of Bennu samples that found stardust, the residue of ancient exploding stars, older than our solar system.Guests: Dr. Stefanie Milam is an astrochemist at NASA and a project scientist for the James Webb Space Telescope.#### Meet 3I/Atlas, An Object From Another Solar System` `### September 3, 2025## How Common Household Products Pollute Our Indoor AirSeptember 3, 2025 \u2022 You have probably given some thought to outdoor air pollution, whether it\u2019s wildfire smoke or smog from traffic.

However, it builds on both countries\u2019 efforts to legitimize quantum, which is often seen as the next frontier in technology.Just this past week, IonQ and Rigetti Computing, two of the best-known quantum pure plays in the U.S., announced separate deals with the federal government.IonQ plans to partner with the Department of Energy to deploy quantum technology in space, while Rigetti was awarded $5.8 million to build quantum networking and sensing technology over the next three years.

ArticleAI Strategy# MIT: Why 95% of Enterprise AI Investments Fail to DeliverBy [Kitty Wheeler](/author/kitty-wheeler)September 08, 20255 minsShareShareMIT finds that despite billions of investment in Gen AI, only 5% of pilots deliver measurable business returns, exposing a widening \u201cGen AI Divide\u201dEnterprise investment in Gen AI has reached US$30bn-US$40bn globally, yet 95% of organisations report zero return on the initiatives.New research from MIT called \u2018The Gen AI Divide State of AI in Business 2025\u2019, examining 300 public implementations, reveals what researchers call the \u201cGen AI Divide\u201d: a split between the small minority achieving substantial value and the majority trapped in failed pilot programmes.The study finds that only 5% of integrated AI pilots extract measurable profit and loss impact \u2013 and the divide stems from implementation approach rather than model quality or regulation.Meanwhile, generic tools like ChatGPT and Microsoft\u2019s Copilot show widespread adoption, with over 80% of organisations exploring them and nearly 40% deploying them.However, these primarily enhance individual productivity rather than organisational performance.Enterprise-grade systems tell a different story. While 60% of organisations evaluate custom or vendor-supplied tools, only 20% reach pilot stage and merely 5% achieve production deployment.Most fail due to brittle workflows and misalignment with daily operations.## Why the \u201cshadow AI economy\u201d bypasses enterprise failuresThe research uncovers a thriving \u201cshadow AI economy\u201d where employees use personal subscriptions for work tasks without approval.Within this economy, the study finds that workers from over 90% of surveyed organisations report regular use of personal AI tools, while only 40% of companies purchase enterprise subscriptions.The study says a corporate lawyer exemplifies this pattern. Her firm invested US$50,000 in a specialised contract analysis tool, yet she consistently uses ChatGPT for drafting.\u201cOur purchased AI tool provided rigid summaries with limited customisation options,\u201d she says. \u201cWith ChatGPT, I can guide the conversation and iterate until I get exactly what I need.\u201dThe same lawyer draws clear boundaries for sensitive work: \u201cIt\u2019s excellent for brainstorming and first drafts, but it doesn\u2019t retain knowledge of client preferences or learn from previous edits,\u201d she explains.\u201cFor high-stakes work, I need a system that accumulates knowledge and improves over time.\u201dThese findings highlight the learning gap keeping most organisations on the wrong side of the divide.Additionally, user preferences reveal 70% favour AI for quick tasks but 90% prefer humans for complex projects requiring sustained attention.## How external partnerships double success ratesMIT finds that strategic partnerships with external vendors reach deployment 67% of the time compared to 33% for internal builds.MIT\u2019s five myths about Gen AI in enterprises:* AI will replace most jobs soon: Layoffs are limited and mostly industry-specific and executives remain divided on future hiring* Gen AI is transforming business: Adoption is high, but only 5% of firms scale AI into workflows \u2013 most sectors show little change* Enterprises are slow adopters: In reality, 90% have seriously explored AI purchases, showing eagerness, not hesitation* Model quality and regulation are the barriers: The real issue is poor workflow integration and tools that don\u2019t learn or adapt* The best AI tools succeed on their own: Success comes when tools are customised, integrated, and tied to measurable outcomesTop performers report 90-day implementation cycles while enterprises typically require nine months or longer.Meanwhile, investment patterns reveal misaligned priorities \u2013 sales and marketing capture 50% of AI budgets despite back-office automation often yielding higher returns.Successful deployments report US$2m-US$10m annual savings through business process outsourcing elimination, 30% reduction in external creative costs and US$1m saved on outsourced risk management.A VP of Procurement at a Fortune 1000 pharmaceutical company told MIT researchers: \u201cIf I buy a tool to help my team work faster, how do I quantify that impact?\u201cHow do I justify it to my CEO when it won\u2019t directly move revenue or decrease measurable costs?\u201dMIT finds that the most effective buyers treat AI vendors as business service providers rather than software suppliers, demanding deep customisation and benchmarking tools on operational outcomes.Top-performing Gen AI startups reach US$1.2m in annualised revenue within 6-12 months by targeting narrow workflows before expanding.A CIO at a US$5bn financial services firm describes the selection reality: \u201cWe\u2019re evaluating five different Gen AI solutions, but whichever system best learns and adapts to our specific processes will ultimately win our business,\u201d he says.\u201cOnce we\u2019ve invested time in training a system to understand our workflows, the switching costs become prohibitive.\u201dA Head of Procurement at a major consumer goods firm captures the vendor evaluation challenge: \u201cI receive numerous emails daily claiming to offer the best Gen AI solution,\u201d she says.\u201cSome have impressive demos, but establishing trust is the real challenge. With so many options flooding our inbox, we rely heavily on peer recommendations and referrals from our network.\u201dOne CIO in the study concludes: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen dozens of demos this year. Maybe one or two are genuinely useful. The rest are wrappers or science projects.\u201d## Tags[MIT](/search?q=MIT)[AI](/search?q=AI)[Gen AI](/search?q=Gen%20AI)[Gen AI Divide](/search?q=Gen%20AI%20Divide)[The Future of AI](/search?q=The%20Future%20of%20AI)[Read Now](/magazine)Related Content* [Behind KPMG Appointing Steve Chase as Global Head of AI AI Strategy](/news/david-rowlands-retires-as-kpmgs-first-global-head-of-ai)* [How Schneider Electric Leads the AI Data Centre Revolution Technology](/videos/how-schneider-electric-leads-the-ai-data-centre-revolution)* [Nirupa Chander](/interviews/nirupa-chander)* [How Schneider Electric Leads the AI Data Centre Revolution](/company-reports/headline-maximum-55-60-characters-how-schneider-electri)By clicking \u201cAccept All Cookies\u201d, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.

ListAI Strategy# Top 10: AI Regulations and Compliance IssuesBy [Kitty Wheeler](/author/kitty-wheeler)June 25, 20257 minsShareShareIn association with Boomi, AI Magazine explores AI regulations and compliance issues as organisations face mounting challenges and legalitiesAs AI develops across the world, it\u2019s becoming harder and harder to employ effective regulations.Gen AI systems for example, are transforming industries from healthcare to finance, as governments worldwide grapple with balancing innovation against emerging risks.The EU leads with its AI Act, imposing strict obligations on high-risk AI applications, while the US pursues a fragmented approach combining federal executive orders with state-level legislation.Meanwhile, the UK adopts principles-based regulation, seeking to maintain its position as an AI hub.This regulatory divergence creates particular challenges for multinational technology companies deploying AI systems across borders \u2013 and the cost of compliance has become a strategic consideration, with organisations investing millions in governance frameworks, legal expertise and technical solutions.## 10. Cross-border data transfers**Why it\u2019s an issue:** Global data flows for AI conflict with national data sovereignty rules **Company tackling this:** Duality TechnologiesAI development requires vast datasets that often span multiple jurisdictions, creating conflicts with data sovereignty regulations including GDPR.For example, the invalidation of the EU-US Privacy Shield in 2020 demonstrated the complexity of compliant transfers.This means that organisations must navigate Standard Contractual Clauses and Binding Corporate Rules, requiring detailed Transfer Impact Assessments.Duality Technologies is one company that addresses these challenges through its SecurePlus platform, which uses homomorphic encryption to enable data collaboration without exposing sensitive information.## 9. AI Governance and risk management**Why it\u2019s an issue:** Proactive frameworks are crucial for managing evolving AI risks and compliance **Company tackling this:** KPMGAI adoption introduces cyber threats, operational failures and regulatory non-compliance risks.As a result, organisations face financial penalties without adequate governance frameworks.Now, managing AI risks has evolved from ad-hoc activities to structured methodologies requiring dedicated tools.Tackling this challenge, KPMG offers a trusted AI framework encompassing reliability, security, safety, privacy, explainability, fairness and accountability.The framework aligns with the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and EU AI Act.## 8. Fragmented global regulatory landscape**Why it\u2019s an issue:** Inconsistent laws create complex, costly and uncertain compliance for global firms **Company tackling this:** TrustArcTrustArc provides AI governance solutions through its PrivacyCentral platform, enabling adherence to various regulations including the EU AI Act and Colorado AI Act.The platform incorporates standards like the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and OECD AI Principles.Platforms like this must exist as global AI regulatory environments vary significantly across jurisdictions.For instance, the EU enacted an AI Act whilst the US relies on state-level laws and federal executive orders.Meanwhile the UK pursues a principles-based framework.Yet this fragmentation creates complex compliance requirements for multinational organisations.## 7. Deepfakes and misinformation**Why it\u2019s an issue:** AI-generated fakes undermine trust and enable fraud/manipulation **Company tackling this:** IntelAI-generated deepfakes threaten public trust, democratic processes and corporate security.Synthetic media including manipulated videos, images and audio are increasingly sophisticated and difficult to distinguish from authentic content.Governments respond with legislation, such as New Hampshire criminalising malicious deepfakes and California\u2019s Defending Democracy from Deepfake Deception Act.In response, Intel developed FakeCatcher, the first real-time deepfake detector analysing biological signals to determine video authenticity.Running on Intel processors, the technology supports multiple real-time detection streams.## 6. Intellectual property rights**Why it\u2019s an issue:** AI training and output challenge existing copyright and ownership laws **\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bCompany tackling this:** AdobeGen AI creates complexities for intellectual property rights, particularly copyright ownership and infringement \u2013 yet most copyright and patent laws do not address AI\u2019s role in authorship or inventorship.Debates centre on whether using copyrighted materials to train AI models constitutes infringement and who owns copyright for AI-generated content.High-profile lawsuits include movie studios suing Midjourney for allegedly copying protected characters.Tackling this copyright challenge, Adobe invests in companies like Truepic, supporting authentication technologies combating deepfakes.Adobe also participates in the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity standard, providing verifiable details about digital content origin and edits.## 5. AI safety and security**Why it\u2019s an issue:** AI introduces novel cyber threats and operational risks **Company tackling this:** Palo Alto NetworksAI deployment creates cybersecurity threats including prompt injections, model inversion and data poisoning that compromise AI accuracy and integrity. As companies are grappling to protect themselves, companies such as Palo Alto Networks provide products and services safeguarding AI systems against novel cyber threats, ensuring model integrity and infrastructure resilience.US authorities including the FBI, NSA and CISA issued joint guidance warning against security threats impacting AI training data and outputs to tackle the problem.## 4. Accountability and human oversight**Why it\u2019s an issue:** Autonomous AI lacks clear human responsibility and control **Company tackling this:** Open AIAI systems gaining autonomy create challenges establishing responsibility and ensuring human oversight.As a result, UNESCO principles mandate that AI systems must not usurp human responsibility and accountability.Human-in-the-Loop approaches embed human judgement in AI operational workflows, particularly for high-stakes domains where errors have consequences.Similarly, Open AI emphasises accountability and human oversight through open-sourced safety research and collaboration with governments on AI governance frameworks.The company focuses on building steerable, interpretable AI systems aligned with human values, ensuring human responsibility remains paramount.## 3. Transparency and explainability**Why it\u2019s an issue:** Opaque AI decisions erode trust and hinder accountability and auditability **Company tackling this:** GoogleThe black box nature of AI systems obscures decision reasoning, eroding user trust and impeding accountability \u2013 leading UNESCO global standards and emerging regulations like the UK AI Bill emphasise transparency and explainability importance.Explainable AI enables compliance by facilitating bias detection and correction whilst ensuring AI judgements in healthcare and finance are comprehensible.Google\u2019s DeepMind division is one enterprise leading ethical AI development emphasising explainable AI in projects.Google\u2019s Gemini models also have reasoning capabilities contributing to understandable AI outputs.## 2. Data privacy and protection**Why it\u2019s an issue:** AI processes vast data, risking breaches and misuse of personal info **Company tackling this:** MicrosoftMicrosoft addresses data privacy and protection challenges in many ways including through its Purview suite delivering unified data governance capabilities.The platform offers automated data discovery and classification with integrated security solutions including Data Loss Prevention and Information Protection across on-premises, multi-cloud and SaaS environments.Microsoft\u2019s Responsible AI principles also embed privacy and security by design throughout AI system lifecycles.Enterprises are innovating in this way as AI systems process immense data volumes raising privacy and protection concerns regarding sensitive personal information.As a result, GDPR compliance is paramount, with EDPB guidelines on data transfers and training courses for Data Protection Officers.Data breaches and personal data misuse rank among top business concerns.## 1. Algorithmic bias and fairness**Why it\u2019s an issue:** Unfair AI leads to discrimination, legal risks and reputational damage **Company tackling this:** IBMAlgorithmic bias from unrepresentative training data results in discriminatory outcomes in hiring processes and loan approvals.Such biases carry legal and reputational risks making fairness pursuit a business imperative. Regulatory bodies enforcing the EU AI Act and US Algorithmic Accountability Act mandate bias mitigation strategies.A company leading in solutions to algorithmic bias and fairness problems is IBM \u2013 that provides the open-source AI Fairness 360 toolkit \u2013 offering 70 fairness metrics and 10 bias mitigation algorithms detecting and reducing discrimination throughout AI application lifecycles.Furthermore, IBM\u2019s AI Ethics Board \u2013 co-chaired by Chief Privacy Officer Christina Montgomery and AI Ethics Global Leader Francesca Rossi, reviews AI use cases ensuring alignment with fairness principles.---*Explore the latest edition of* *AI Magazine* *and be part of the conversation at our global conference series,* *Tech & AI LIVE**.**Discover all our* *upcoming events* *and secure your tickets today.* *Also sign up to our* *free weekly newsletter* *for the latest insights and stories straight into your inbox.*---*AI Magazine is a* *BizClik* *brand*## Company portals* ### [Google](/company/google)* ### [IBM](/company/ibm)* ### [Intel](/company/intel)* ### [KPMG](/company/kpmg)* ### [Microsoft](/company/microsoft)* ### [OpenAI](/company/open-ai)* ### [Palo Alto Networks](/company/palo-alto-networks)## Tags[AI](/search?q=AI)[AI Reuglation](/search?q=AI%20Reuglation)[AI Compliance](/search?q=AI%20Compliance)Company Portals* ### [Google](/company/google)* ### [IBM](/company/ibm)* ### [Intel](/company/intel)* ### [KPMG](/company/kpmg)* ### [Microsoft](/company/microsoft)* ### [OpenAI](/company/open-ai)* ### [Palo Alto Networks](/company/palo-alto-networks)[Read Now](/magazine)Related Content* [Behind Microsoft & OpenAI\u2019s Redefined Partnership in AI AI Strategy](/news/behind-microsoft-openais-redefined-partnership-in-ai)* [Greg Ogle: The CIO Behind Flexential\u2019s AI Push AI Strategy](/news/flexential-names-data-centre-veteran-greg-ogle-cio-to-lead-ai-strategy)* [Delska Targets Hyperscaler Expansion Across the Baltics](/company-reports/delska-targets-hyperscaler-expansion-across-the-baltics)* [PwC: How is Investment in Semiconductors Driving AI & EVs?

Despite growing interest, the concept of AI-assisted nursing care lacks clear consensus, hindering its clinical operationalization. This study aims to clarify this concept through a concept analysis to inform future research and practice.### MethodsThe Walker and Avant concept analysis method was utilized to examine \u2018AI-assisted nursing care.\u2019 A literature review was conducted across databases including PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Embase, with no temporal limits, yielding 20 relevant records for analysis. The process identified the concept\u2019s uses, attributes, antecedents, consequences, and empirical referents.### ResultsFive defining attributes of AI-assisted nursing care emerged: data-driven decision support, automation of routine tasks, enhanced predictive capabilities, personalization of care, and continuous learning and adaptability. Antecedents included availability of advanced technology, integration into healthcare systems, nursing competence and acceptance, patient data availability, and ethical and regulatory frameworks. Consequences encompassed improved patient outcomes, increased nursing efficiency, enhanced nurses\u2019 satisfaction, potential cost savings, and ethical and social challenges. Model, borderline, and contrary cases further illustrated the concept\u2019s application.### ConclusionAI-assisted nursing care holds significant promise for revolutionizing clinical practice by improving care quality and nursing workflows. However, its implementation demands addressing technological, ethical, and systemic challenges. Future research should prioritize empirical validation of these findings and promote equitable access to AI technologies across diverse healthcare settings to fully realize its potential.[Peer Review reports](/articles/10.1186/s12912-025-03818-y/peer-review)## BackgroundTechnological innovations have significantly impacted human life, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerging as a key driver of change.

The concepts \u201cArtificial Intelligence,\u201d \u201cnurse\u201d, \u201cnursing\u201d, and \u201cnursing care\u201d were searched using Boolean operators \u201cAND\u201d and \u201cOR\u201d in the title and abstract fields of each database (Supplementary Material [1](/articles/10.1186/s12912-025-03818-y#MOESM1)). No temporal limits were applied and articles published in either English or Persian until 2025/03/30 were retrieved. Studies relevant to the aim of this study, which contributed to identifying the antecedents, attributes, or consequences of the concept \u2018AI-Assisted Nursing Care,\u2019 were included. Studies outside the scope or those that did not provide relevant information for the study\u2019s objectives were excluded. This study was done according to the relevant guidelines for concept analysis and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist, with quality assessment of included studies conducted using appropriate tools such as the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklists, CASP Checklists, PRISMA-P, and AMSTAR 2, as detailed in the Results.## ResultsInitially, 6521 records were identified (by author Reza Nematollahi Maleki) by searching the titles and abstracts of these databases. Subsequently, 23 additional records were manually included, resulting in a total of 6544 records. Duplicate records were removed (by authors Mina Hoseinzadeh and Shahla Shahbazi), leading to an initial selection of 4236 records. Authors Reza Nematollahi Maleki and Mansour Ghafourifard screened the titles and abstracts, applying eligibility criteria to the full texts of 82 selected records.

This system fully incorporates all five attributes, enhancing every aspect of Emily\u2019s care. The AI systems continuously monitor Mr. Thompson\u2019s vital signs and lab results. When it detects a slight drop in blood pressure and a minor increase in heart rate, it alerts Emily to early signs of dehydration. She reviews the AI\u2019s analysis and adjusts his IV fluids promptly using clinical judgement, preventing a potential setback. The system automatically updates Mr. Thompson\u2019s electronic health record (EHR) with his latest vitals and Emily\u2019s observations. It also schedules his physical therapy sessions based on his progress and the therapist\u2019s availability, allowing Emily to focus on direct patient care instead of administrative tasks. It analyzes Mr. Thompson\u2019s age, medication history, and sleep patterns, predicting a high risk of post-operative delirium. It suggests adjusting his pain management to avoid sedatives and scheduling quiet hours for rest. Emily, after a thorough assessment and validating the AI\u2019s analysis, implements these recommendations, reducing his risk of confusion. Knowing Mr. Thompson has a history of anxiety, the AI system customizes his care plan by recommending mindfulness exercises and adjusting medications to minimize anxiety triggers. Emily first makes sure the new care plan is valid and evidence-based and then she acts based on her own judgment and AI\u2019s analysis to help him feel more comfortable during recovery without causing any unintentional harm. After Mr. Thompson recovers successfully, it incorporates his data to improve its algorithms for future patients. It also integrates the latest research on post-operative care, ensuring Emily\u2019s interventions remain cutting-edge.### Borderline caseNurse Liam works at a mid-sized clinic with a basic AI system, which supports some attributes but not others. He\u2019s caring for Mrs. Garcia, a 52-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes. The AI system automates Mrs. Garcia\u2019s appointment scheduling and sends her reminders for check-ups and medication refills. It also transcribes Liam\u2019s verbal notes into her EHR, reducing his documentation time. The system compiles Mrs. Garcia\u2019s blood sugar readings and weight into a dashboard, alerting Liam when her levels are abnormal. This helps him quickly adjust her insulin dosage when needed, though it doesn\u2019t offer detailed recommendations.### Contrary caseNurse Sarah works in a rural health center with no AI tools, relying entirely on traditional methods to care for Mr. Patel, a 75-year-old man with chronic heart failure. Sarah records Mr. Patel\u2019s vital signs manually and reviews his paper chart. When his weight increases slightly, she misses the early sign of fluid retention until he reports shortness of breath days later, delaying treatment. Sarah spends hours scheduling appointments, handwriting notes, and managing supplies. This workload reduces her time to educate Mr. Patel on diet and medication, increasing his risk of worsening symptoms. As a typical nurse, Sarah can\u2019t foresee Mr. Patel\u2019s risk of a heart failure exacerbation. When he develops severe edema unexpectedly, she reacts after the fact, adjusting his diuretics under pressure. The clinic uses a standard heart failure plan for all patients. Despite Mr. Patel\u2019s limited mobility and preference for low-sodium cultural foods, his care isn\u2019t tailored, missing chances to improve his adherence and comfort. Sarah lacks access to updated guidelines or data insights. Her care is based on outdated training, potentially overlooking newer, more effective heart failure treatments. One of his coworkers suggests that Sarah uses AI for selecting nursing diagnoses, but she refuses, stating, \u2018I cannot rely on a machine and do not trust AI!### Identify antecedents and consequencesWalker and Avant (2011) provided a clear definition of antecedents as events or attributes that precede the occurrence of a concept, whereas consequences refer to events that ensue from the concept\u2019s occurrence [[10](/articles/10.1186/s12912-025-03818-y#ref-CR10 \"Walker LO, Avant KC.

The empirical referents, while promising, lack fully standardized tools, limiting their current applicability. Future research should validate these findings empirically, refine measurement instruments, and address equitable AI access across diverse healthcare contexts.## ConclusionAI-assisted nursing care holds immense potential to revolutionize nursing by enhancing patient outcomes, efficiency, and nurses\u2019 well-being. This concept analysis, through its systematic exploration of attributes, antecedents, consequences, and referents, provides a robust framework for its understanding and implementation. As healthcare evolves, sustained efforts in education, research, and ethical governance will ensure AI augments nursing practice effectively, preserving the profession\u2019s core focus on compassionate, high-quality care.## Data availabilityNo datasets were generated or analysed during the current study.## AbbreviationsAI:: Artificial IntelligencePRISMA:: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-AnalysesEHR:: Electronic Health Record## References1.

But most models today only consider a few specific types of data or variables. Compare that with human scientists, who work in a collaborative environment and consider experimental results, the broader scientific literature, imaging and structural analysis, personal experience or intuition, and input from colleagues and peer reviewers.Now, MIT researchers have developed a method for optimizing materials recipes and planning experiments that incorporates information from diverse sources like insights from the literature, chemical compositions, microstructural images, and more. The approach is part of a new platform, named Copilot for Real-world Experimental Scientists (CRESt), that also uses robotic equipment for high-throughput materials testing, the results of which are fed back into large multimodal models to further optimize materials recipes.Human researchers can converse with the system in natural language, with no coding required, and the system makes its own observations and hypotheses along the way. Cameras and visual language models also allow the system to monitor experiments, detect issues, and suggest corrections.\u201cIn the field of AI for science, the key is designing new experiments,\u201d says Ju Li, School of Engineering Carl Richard Soderberg Professor of Power Engineering. \u201cWe use multimodal feedback \u2014 for example information from previous literature on how palladium behaved in fuel cells at this temperature, and human feedback \u2014 to complement experimental data and design new experiments. We also use robots to synthesize and characterize the material\u2019s structure and to test performance.\u201dThe system is described in a paper published in *Nature*. The researchers used CRESt to explore more than 900 chemistries and conduct 3,500 electrochemical tests, leading to the discovery of a catalyst material that delivered record power density in a fuel cell that runs on formate salt to produce electricity.Joining Li on the paper as first authors are PhD student Zhen Zhang, Zhichu Ren PhD \u201924, PhD student Chia-Wei Hsu, and postdoc Weibin Chen.

They require researchers to carefully design workflows, make new material, and run a series of tests and analysis to understand what happened. Those results are then used to decide how to improve the material.To improve the process, some researchers have turned to a machine-learning strategy known as active learning to make efficient use of previous experimental data points and explore or exploit those data. When paired with a statistical technique known as Bayesian optimization (BO), active learning has helped researchers identify new materials for things like batteries and advanced semiconductors.\u201cBayesian optimization is like Netflix recommending the next movie to watch based on your viewing history, except instead it recommends the next experiment to do,\u201d Li explains. \u201cBut basic Bayesian optimization is too simplistic. It uses a boxed-in design space, so if I say I\u2019m going to use platinum, palladium, and iron, it only changes the ratio of those elements in this small space. But real materials have a lot more dependencies, and BO often gets lost.\u201dMost active learning approaches also rely on single data streams that don\u2019t capture everything that goes on in an experiment. To equip computational systems with more human-like knowledge, while still taking advantage of the speed and control of automated systems, Li and his collaborators built CRESt.CRESt\u2019s robotic equipment includes a liquid-handling robot, a carbothermal shock system to rapidly synthesize materials, an automated electrochemical workstation for testing, characterization equipment including automated electron microscopy and optical microscopy, and auxiliary devices such as pumps and gas valves, which can also be remotely controlled. Many processing parameters can also be tuned.With the user interface, researchers can chat with CRESt and tell it to use active learning to find promising materials recipes for different projects. CRESt can include up to 20 precursor molecules and substrates into its recipe. To guide material designs, CRESt\u2019s models search through scientific papers for descriptions of elements or precursor molecules that might be useful. When human researchers tell CRESt to pursue new recipes, it kicks off a robotic symphony of sample preparation, characterization, and testing. The researcher can also ask CRESt to perform image analysis from scanning electron microscopy imaging, X-ray diffraction, and other sources.Information from those processes is used to train the active learning models, which use both literature knowledge and current experimental results to suggest further experiments and accelerate materials discovery.\u201cFor each recipe we use previous literature text or databases, and it creates these huge representations of every recipe based on the previous knowledge base before even doing the experiment,\u201d says Li. \u201cWe perform principal component analysis in this knowledge embedding space to get a reduced search space that captures most of the performance variability. Then we use Bayesian optimization in this reduced space to design the new experiment. After the new experiment, we feed newly acquired multimodal experimental data and human feedback into a large language model to augment the knowledgebase and redefine the reduced search space, which gives us a big boost in active learning efficiency.\u201dMaterials science experiments can also face reproducibility challenges. To address the problem, CRESt monitors its experiments with cameras, looking for potential problems and suggesting solutions via text and voice to human researchers.The researchers used CRESt to develop an electrode material for an advanced type of high-density fuel cell known as a direct formate fuel cell. After exploring more than 900 chemistries over three months, CRESt discovered a catalyst material made from eight elements that achieved a 9.3-fold improvement in power density per dollar over pure palladium, an expensive precious metal. In further tests, CRESTs material was used to deliver a record power density to a working direct formate fuel cell even though the cell contained just one-fourth of the precious metals of previous devices.The results show the potential for CRESt to find solutions to real-world energy problems that have plagued the materials science and engineering community for decades.\u201cA significant challenge for fuel-cell catalysts is the use of precious metal,\u201d says Zhang. \u201cFor fuel cells, researchers have used various precious metals like palladium and platinum. We used a multielement catalyst that also incorporates many other cheap elements to create the optimal coordination environment for catalytic activity and resistance to poisoning species such as carbon monoxide and adsorbed hydrogen atom. People have been searching low-cost options for many years. This system greatly accelerated our search for these catalysts.\u201d**A helpful assistant**Early on, poor reproducibility emerged as a major problem that limited the researchers\u2019 ability to perform their new active learning technique on experimental datasets. Material properties can be influenced by the way the precursors are mixed and processed, and any number of problems can subtly alter experimental conditions, requiring careful inspection to correct.To partially automate the process, the researchers coupled computer vision and vision language models with domain knowledge from the scientific literature, which allowed the system to hypothesize sources of irreproducibility and propose solutions. For example, the models can notice when there\u2019s a millimeter-sized deviation in a sample\u2019s shape or when a pipette moves something out of place. The researchers incorporated some of the model\u2019s suggestions, leading to improved consistency, suggesting the models already make good experimental assistants.The researchers noted that humans still performed most of the debugging in their experiments.\u201cCREST is an assistant, not a replacement, for human researchers,\u201d Li says. \u201cHuman researchers are still indispensable. In fact, we use natural language so the system can explain what it is doing and present observations and hypotheses. But this is a step toward more flexible, self-driving labs.\u201d### Share this news article on:* X* Facebook* LinkedIn* Reddit* [Print](#)## PaperPaper: \u201cA multimodal robotic platform for multi-element electrocatalyst discovery\u201dCheck for open access version(s) of the research mentioned in this article.## Related Links* Ju Li* Department of Materials Science and Engineering* Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering* School of Engineering## Related Topics* [Research](/topic/research)* [Materials science and engineering](/topic/materialsscienceandengineering)* [Energy](/topic/energy)* [Artificial intelligence](/topic/artificial-intelligence2)* [Machine learning](/topic/machine-learning)* [Nanoscience and nanotechnology](/topic/nanotech)* [DMSE](/topic/dmse)* [Nuclear science and engineering](/topic/nuclear-engineering)* [MIT.nano](/topic/mitnano)* [School of Engineering](/topic/school-engineering)## Related Articles### [For clean ammonia, MIT engineers propose going underground](/2025/clean-ammonia-mit-engineers-propose-going-underground-0121)### [New computational chemistry techniques accelerate the prediction of molecules and materials](/2025/new-computational-chemistry-techniques-accelerate-prediction-molecules-materials-0114)### [Nanoscale transistors could enable more efficient electronics](/2024/nanoscale-transistors-could-enable-more-efficient-electronics-1104)## More MIT News### [MIT engineers develop a magnetic transistor for more energy-efficient electronics](/2025/mit-engineers-develop-magnetic-transistor-more-energy-efficient-electronics-0923)A new device concept opens the door to compact, high-performance transistors with built-in memory.[Read full story](/2025/mit-engineers-develop-magnetic-transistor-more-energy-efficient-electronics-0923) \u2192### [How federal research support has helped create life-changing medicines](/2025/how-federal-research-support-has-helped-create-life-changing-medicines-0925)A new study finds over half the drugs approved this century cite government-funded research in their patents.[Read full story](/2025/how-federal-research-support-has-helped-create-life-changing-medicines-0925) \u2192### [New AI system could accelerate clinical research](/2025/new-ai-system-could-accelerate-clinical-research-0925)By enabling rapid annotation of areas of interest in medical images, the tool can help scientists study new treatments or map disease progression.[Read full story](/2025/new-ai-system-could-accelerate-clinical-research-0925) \u2192### [Study shows mucus contains molecules that block Salmonella infection](/2025/study-shows-mucus-contains-molecules-that-block-salmonella-infection-0925)MIT researchers now hope to develop synthetic versions of these molecules, which could be used to treat or prevent foodborne illnesses.[Read full story](/2025/study-shows-mucus-contains-molecules-that-block-salmonella-infection-0925) \u2192### [Technique makes complex 3D printed parts more reliable](/2025/technique-makes-complex-3d-printed-parts-more-reliable-0925)New research enables computer designs to incorporate the limitations of 3D printers, to better control materials\u2019 performance in aerospace, medical, and other applications.[Read full story](/2025/technique-makes-complex-3d-printed-parts-more-reliable-0925) \u2192### [Signposts on the way to new territory](/2025/signposts-way-new-territory-0924)Professors Zachary Hartwig and Wanda Orlikowski are honored as \u201cCommitted to Caring.\u201d[Read full story](/2025/signposts-way-new-territory-0924) \u2192* [More news on MIT News homepage](/) \u2192Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyMassachusetts Institute of Technology77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, USARecommended Links:* Visit* Map (opens in new window)* Events (opens in new window)* People (opens in new window)* Careers (opens in new window)* Contact* Privacy* Accessibility* + Social Media Hub + MIT on X + MIT on Facebook + MIT on YouTube + MIT on Instagram"
