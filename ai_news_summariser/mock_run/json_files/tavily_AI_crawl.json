Not to mention the robots on the assembly lines in factories. But how far are we from having a human-like robot at home? For example, a robot housekeeper like Rosie from \u201cThe Jetsons.\u201d She didn\u2019t just cook and clean, she bantered and bonded with the Jetsons. Stanford roboticist Karen Liu joined Host Ira Flatow to talk about how AI is driving advances in humanoid robotics at a live show at the Fox Theatre in Redwood City, California.Guest: Dr. Karen Liu is a professor of computer science at Stanford University.Transcripts for each episode are available within 1-3 days at sciencefriday.com.*Subscribe to this podcast.* *Plus, to stay updated on all things science,****sign up for Science Friday's newsletters****.*#### How AI Advances Are Improving Humanoid Robots******Listen****\u00b7 18:18******18-Minute Listen****Playlist******Toggle more options**- **Download**- ****Embed**** **Embed** **` `**### September 24, 2025## The High-Tech Lab Unlocking Secrets Of Coral ReproductionSeptember 24, 2025 \u2022 In the heart of San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Park, scientists are on the cutting edge of growing coral. Rising ocean temperatures have caused mass coral bleaching, and experts are racing against the clock to figure out how to help corals be more resilient to stress.Coral scientist Rebecca Albright joined Host Ira Flatow at our live show at the Fox Theater in Redwood City, California, to talk about the work her lab does to help corals reproduce\u2014romantic lighting and full moons included.Guest: Dr. Rebecca Albright is a coral reef biologist, an associate curator, and a Patterson Scholar at the California Academy of Sciences.*Transcripts for each episode are available within 1-3 days at* *sciencefriday.com.**Subscribe to this podcast.* *Plus, to stay updated on all things science,****sign up for Science Friday's newsletters****.*#### The High-Tech Lab Unlocking Secrets Of Coral Reproduction******Listen****\u00b7 18:17******18-Minute Listen****Playlist******Toggle more options**- **Download**- ****Embed**** **Embed** **` `**### September 23, 2025## The Humble Microbe Could Help Us Understand Life ItselfSeptember 23, 2025 \u2022 Sift through your memories and excavate an image of a fossil. Maybe you\u2019re picturing dinosaur bones, the imprint of an ammonite, or the fronds of a fern etched into stone. But there\u2019s a whole other category of fossilized remains that can tell us about life way before *T. rexes*, or even twigs, existed on this planet. That\u2019s fossilized evidence of microbes.Microbiologist Paula Welander uses these ancient remains to understand how life began on Earth. She joined Host Flora Lichtman for our live show at the Fox Theater in Redwood City, California, to talk about how her work may help us find life elsewhere in the universe.Guest: Dr. Paula Welander is a professor of Earth system science at Stanford University.*Transcripts for each episode are available within 1-3 days at* *sciencefriday.com.* *Subscribe to this podcast.* *Plus, to stay updated on all things science,****sign up for Science Friday's newsletters****.*#### The Humble Microbe Could Help Us Understand Life Itself******Listen****\u00b7 12:48******12-Minute Listen****Playlist******Toggle more options**- **Download**- ****Embed**** **Embed** **` `**### September 22, 2025## Raising A New Generation Of Bat Conservationists In West AfricaSeptember 22, 2025 \u2022 Nigeria is home to 100 known species of bats\u2014about a third of Africa\u2019s bat species\u2014but scientists don\u2019t know much about them. Ecologists Iroro Tanshi and Benneth Obitte, collaborators and life partners, are trying to change that. In addition to studying and protecting the bats of their homeland, they\u2019re also working to raise up a whole network of bat scientists across West Africa. Host Flora Lichtman talks with them about how they started their work, what they\u2019ve learned, and how they\u2019re paving the way for other bat conservationists.

Almost a third of North American bird species are in decline, and in the last five decades, more than 100 species have lost over half of their populations. This is primarily due to lack of food\u2014fewer insects to eat\u2014and habitat loss, like the development of grasslands. But there\u2019s a bright spot: Some birds that were once rare are now abundant, like the merlin, sandhill crane, and pileated woodpecker. Host Ira Flatow talks with biologist Tom Langen, who explains these birds\u2019 remarkable comebacks, and discusses his conservation work to bring threatened fish species back from the brink.

But in nature, species often rely on each other for survival. While humans think they\u2019re in control of relationships between other species, like dogs and even the yeast for our breads, the opposite is often true.Host Flora Lichtman speaks with ecologist Rob Dunn, whose new book, *The Call of the Honeyguide*, argues that mutualisms are the story of life itself.Read an excerpt of *The Call of the Honeyguide: What Science Tells Us about How to Live Well with the Rest of Life.**Transcripts for each episode are available within 1-3 days at* *sciencefriday.com.**Subscribe to this podcast.* *Plus, to stay updated on all things science,****sign up for Science Friday's newsletters****.*#### Teamwork Between Species Is The Key To Life Itself******Listen****\u00b7 18:31******18-Minute Listen****Playlist******Toggle more options**- **Download**- ****Embed**** **Embed** **` `**### September 17, 2025## If An Asteroid Were Headed For Earth, Would We Be Ready?September 17, 2025 \u2022 You might remember news reporting from earlier this year that a 180-foot asteroid had about a 3% chance of hitting Earth in 2032. And if it did, it would unleash energy equivalent to hundreds of nuclear bombs. After further observations, astronomers revised that probability way down, to close to zero. So what is our current capability to spot Earthbound asteroids? And how are governments preparing to communicate and respond to a potential impact on a populated area?Joining Host Ira Flatow with some of the answers are Kelly Fast, from NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office, and Leviticus \u201cL.A.\u201d Lewis, former FEMA liaison for that office.Guests: Dr. Kelly Fast is the acting planetary defense officer in NASA\u2019s Planetary Defense Coordination Office, based in Laurel, Maryland.#### If An Asteroid Were Headed For Earth, Would We Be Ready?******Listen****\u00b7 18:39******18-Minute Listen****Playlist******Toggle more options**- **Download**- ****Embed**** **Embed** **` `**### September 16, 2025## A Trailblazing Geneticist Reflects On Her Life And WorkSeptember 16, 2025 \u2022 It\u2019s common knowledge that many diseases and conditions have some kind of genetic link. But that wasn't always the case. In 1990, long before the Human Genome Project tied so many health issues to differences in genetics, researchers identified a gene called BRCA1. It was the first gene linked to a hereditary form of any common cancer. People with certain variants of BRCA1 stood a higher risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer than those without those mutations. Geneticist Mary-Claire King and her lab were the first to identify that gene. She joins Host Flora Lichtman to talk about her background, her research, and her approach to science.Guest: Dr. Mary-Claire King is an American Cancer Society Professor in the departments of Genome Sciences and Medicine at the University of Washington in Seattle.*Transcripts for each episode are available within 1-3 days at* *sciencefriday.com.**Subscribe to this podcast.* *Plus, to stay updated on all things science,****sign up for Science Friday's newsletters****.*#### A Trailblazing Geneticist Reflects On Her Life And Work******Listen****\u00b7 48:13******48-Minute Listen****Playlist******Toggle more options**- **Download**- ****Embed**** **Embed** **` `**### September 15, 2025## What The Label Of \u2018Genius\u2019 Tells Us About Our SocietySeptember 15, 2025 \u2022 What makes someone a genius? Are they the smartest, most creative, most innovative people? Those with the highest IQ? Who we consider a genius may actually tell us much more about what we value as a society than any objective measure of brilliance. A compelling or quirky life story often shapes who is elevated to genius status.Host Ira Flatow unpacks the complicated and coveted title of genius with Helen Lewis, author of T*he Genius Myth: A Curious History of A Dangerous Idea*.Read an excerpt of *The Genius Myth: A Curious History of A Dangerous Idea.*Guest: Helen Lewis is a staff writer at *The Atlantic*, based in London, who writes about politics and culture.*Transcripts for each episode are available within 1-3 days at* *sciencefriday.com.**Subscribe to this podcast.* *Plus, to stay updated on all things science,****sign up for Science Friday's newsletters****.*#### What The Label Of \u2018Genius\u2019 Tells Us About Our Society******Listen****\u00b7 18:41******18-Minute Listen****Playlist******Toggle more options**- **Download**- ****Embed**** **Embed** **` `**### September 12, 2025## The Human Obsession With Aliens Goes Way, Way BackSeptember 12, 2025 \u2022 A video shown on Capitol Hill on September 9 reportedly shows an American hellfire missile attacking and simply bouncing off a UAP (the military term for a UFO). When videos like this come out, speculation about aliens often follows. But our obsession with aliens isn\u2019t new\u2014and it didn\u2019t begin with 1950s alien invasion movies like \u201cThe Day The Earth Stood Still,\u201d or even with Orson Welles\u2019 \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d mock news bulletins of the 1930s.As science reporter Becky Ferreira writes in her upcoming book, *First Contact: The Story Of Our Obsession With Aliens*, humans have been fascinated with the potential for alien life for about as long we\u2019ve been around. She joins Host Ira Flatow to discuss how our views of beings from other worlds changed throughout the millennia, and where we\u2019re at now with scientific exploration of life beyond Earth.Plus, science journalist Umair Irfan joins Ira to share other stories from the week in science, including what\u2019s going on in a decision-making brain, the trouble with vector-borne illnesses, and the unusual tale of an ant queen that breeds ants of another species.Read an excerpt of *First Contact: The Story Of Our Obsession With Aliens*.Guests:#### The Human Obsession With Aliens Goes Way, Way Back******Listen****\u00b7 25:23******25-Minute Listen****Playlist******Toggle more options**- **Download**- ****Embed**** **Embed** **` `**More from Science FridayLoad more episodes###### Read & Listen- [Home](/)- [News](/sections/news/)- [Culture](/sections/culture/)- [Music](/music/)- [Podcasts & Shows](/podcasts-and-shows)###### Connect- [Newsletters](/newsletters/)- Facebook- Instagram- [Press](/series/750003/press-room/)- [Public Editor](/sections/publiceditor/)- [Corrections](/corrections/)- [Transcripts](/transcripts/)- Contact & Help###### About NPR- [Overview](/about/)- [Diversity](/diversity/)- [NPR Network](/network/)- [Accessibility](/about-npr/1136563345/accessibility)- [Ethics](/ethics/)- [Finances](/about-npr/178660742/public-radio-finances)###### Get Involved- [Support Public Radio](/support/)- [Sponsor NPR](/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship)- [NPR Careers](/careers/)- NPR Shop- NPR Events- [NPR Extra](/sections/npr-extra/)- [Terms of Use](/about-npr/179876898/terms-of-use)- [Privacy](/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy)- [Your Privacy Choices](/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy#yourchoices)- Text Only- \u00a9 2025 nprSponsor MessageSponsor Message[Become an NPR sponsor](/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship)!NPR logo## Cookie SettingsWhen you visit our website, we store cookies on your browser to collect information.

Despite growing interest, the concept of AI-assisted nursing care lacks clear consensus, hindering its clinical operationalization. This study aims to clarify this concept through a concept analysis to inform future research and practice.### MethodsThe Walker and Avant concept analysis method was utilized to examine \u2018AI-assisted nursing care.\u2019 A literature review was conducted across databases including PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Embase, with no temporal limits, yielding 20 relevant records for analysis. The process identified the concept\u2019s uses, attributes, antecedents, consequences, and empirical referents.### ResultsFive defining attributes of AI-assisted nursing care emerged: data-driven decision support, automation of routine tasks, enhanced predictive capabilities, personalization of care, and continuous learning and adaptability. Antecedents included availability of advanced technology, integration into healthcare systems, nursing competence and acceptance, patient data availability, and ethical and regulatory frameworks. Consequences encompassed improved patient outcomes, increased nursing efficiency, enhanced nurses\u2019 satisfaction, potential cost savings, and ethical and social challenges. Model, borderline, and contrary cases further illustrated the concept\u2019s application.### ConclusionAI-assisted nursing care holds significant promise for revolutionizing clinical practice by improving care quality and nursing workflows. However, its implementation demands addressing technological, ethical, and systemic challenges. Future research should prioritize empirical validation of these findings and promote equitable access to AI technologies across diverse healthcare settings to fully realize its potential.[Peer Review reports](/articles/10.1186/s12912-025-03818-y/peer-review)## BackgroundTechnological innovations have significantly impacted human life, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerging as a key driver of change.

In this context, AI-assisted nursing care focuses on augmenting nursing-specific tasks, such as patient monitoring, documentation, and care coordination, rather than broader diagnostic functions typically handled by physicians. The AI-assisted nursing care suggests a paradigm change in how health care is delivered, with possible improvements in efficiency, accuracy, and better patient outcomes [[3](/articles/10.1186/s12912-025-03818-y#ref-CR3 \"Ventura-Silva J, Martins MM, LdL T, AdCa F, Pereira S, Zuge SS, Ribeiro OMPL.

While some have adopted AI technologies, many are still in the initial stages of such adoption or exploration processes. Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively analyze the concept of AI-assisted nursing care within the environment of clinical practice. We try to draw on a foundation for future research, policy-making, and practical use by clarifying the attributes, antecedents, and consequences of this concept by utilizing the Walker and Avant method.## Methods### DesignWalker and Avant\u2019s concept analysis method was used as a rigorous and systematic approach to identify descriptions, antecedents, consequences, and empirical referents of the concept. The stages of the concept analysis method are as follows: (1) selecting a concept, (2) determining the aims or purposes of the analysis, (3) identifying all uses of the concept that you can discover, (4) determining the defining attributes, (5) identifying a model case, (6) identifying borderline, related, contrary, invented, and illegitimate cases, (7) identifying antecedents and consequences, and (8) defining empirical referents (Table [1](/articles/10.1186/s12912-025-03818-y#Tab1)) [[10](/articles/10.1186/s12912-025-03818-y#ref-CR10 \"Walker LO, Avant KC.

The concepts \u201cArtificial Intelligence,\u201d \u201cnurse\u201d, \u201cnursing\u201d, and \u201cnursing care\u201d were searched using Boolean operators \u201cAND\u201d and \u201cOR\u201d in the title and abstract fields of each database (Supplementary Material [1](/articles/10.1186/s12912-025-03818-y#MOESM1)). No temporal limits were applied and articles published in either English or Persian until 2025/03/30 were retrieved. Studies relevant to the aim of this study, which contributed to identifying the antecedents, attributes, or consequences of the concept \u2018AI-Assisted Nursing Care,\u2019 were included. Studies outside the scope or those that did not provide relevant information for the study\u2019s objectives were excluded. This study was done according to the relevant guidelines for concept analysis and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist, with quality assessment of included studies conducted using appropriate tools such as the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklists, CASP Checklists, PRISMA-P, and AMSTAR 2, as detailed in the Results.## ResultsInitially, 6521 records were identified (by author Reza Nematollahi Maleki) by searching the titles and abstracts of these databases. Subsequently, 23 additional records were manually included, resulting in a total of 6544 records. Duplicate records were removed (by authors Mina Hoseinzadeh and Shahla Shahbazi), leading to an initial selection of 4236 records. Authors Reza Nematollahi Maleki and Mansour Ghafourifard screened the titles and abstracts, applying eligibility criteria to the full texts of 82 selected records. All authors evaluated these 82 studies for inclusion in the concept analysis, consulting the research team to resolve any doubts about inclusion or exclusion. Ultimately, 20 records met the criteria and underwent comprehensive concept analysis (Fig. [1](/articles/10.1186/s12912-025-03818-y#Fig1)).

This system fully incorporates all five attributes, enhancing every aspect of Emily\u2019s care. The AI systems continuously monitor Mr. Thompson\u2019s vital signs and lab results. When it detects a slight drop in blood pressure and a minor increase in heart rate, it alerts Emily to early signs of dehydration. She reviews the AI\u2019s analysis and adjusts his IV fluids promptly using clinical judgement, preventing a potential setback. The system automatically updates Mr. Thompson\u2019s electronic health record (EHR) with his latest vitals and Emily\u2019s observations. It also schedules his physical therapy sessions based on his progress and the therapist\u2019s availability, allowing Emily to focus on direct patient care instead of administrative tasks. It analyzes Mr. Thompson\u2019s age, medication history, and sleep patterns, predicting a high risk of post-operative delirium. It suggests adjusting his pain management to avoid sedatives and scheduling quiet hours for rest. Emily, after a thorough assessment and validating the AI\u2019s analysis, implements these recommendations, reducing his risk of confusion. Knowing Mr. Thompson has a history of anxiety, the AI system customizes his care plan by recommending mindfulness exercises and adjusting medications to minimize anxiety triggers. Emily first makes sure the new care plan is valid and evidence-based and then she acts based on her own judgment and AI\u2019s analysis to help him feel more comfortable during recovery without causing any unintentional harm. After Mr. Thompson recovers successfully, it incorporates his data to improve its algorithms for future patients. It also integrates the latest research on post-operative care, ensuring Emily\u2019s interventions remain cutting-edge.### Borderline caseNurse Liam works at a mid-sized clinic with a basic AI system, which supports some attributes but not others. He\u2019s caring for Mrs. Garcia, a 52-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes. The AI system automates Mrs. Garcia\u2019s appointment scheduling and sends her reminders for check-ups and medication refills. It also transcribes Liam\u2019s verbal notes into her EHR, reducing his documentation time. The system compiles Mrs. Garcia\u2019s blood sugar readings and weight into a dashboard, alerting Liam when her levels are abnormal. This helps him quickly adjust her insulin dosage when needed, though it doesn\u2019t offer detailed recommendations.### Contrary caseNurse Sarah works in a rural health center with no AI tools, relying entirely on traditional methods to care for Mr. Patel, a 75-year-old man with chronic heart failure. Sarah records Mr. Patel\u2019s vital signs manually and reviews his paper chart. When his weight increases slightly, she misses the early sign of fluid retention until he reports shortness of breath days later, delaying treatment. Sarah spends hours scheduling appointments, handwriting notes, and managing supplies. This workload reduces her time to educate Mr. Patel on diet and medication, increasing his risk of worsening symptoms. As a typical nurse, Sarah can\u2019t foresee Mr. Patel\u2019s risk of a heart failure exacerbation. When he develops severe edema unexpectedly, she reacts after the fact, adjusting his diuretics under pressure. The clinic uses a standard heart failure plan for all patients. Despite Mr. Patel\u2019s limited mobility and preference for low-sodium cultural foods, his care isn\u2019t tailored, missing chances to improve his adherence and comfort. Sarah lacks access to updated guidelines or data insights. Her care is based on outdated training, potentially overlooking newer, more effective heart failure treatments. One of his coworkers suggests that Sarah uses AI for selecting nursing diagnoses, but she refuses, stating, \u2018I cannot rely on a machine and do not trust AI!### Identify antecedents and consequencesWalker and Avant (2011) provided a clear definition of antecedents as events or attributes that precede the occurrence of a concept, whereas consequences refer to events that ensue from the concept\u2019s occurrence [[10](/articles/10.1186/s12912-025-03818-y#ref-CR10 \"Walker LO, Avant KC.

Future research should validate these findings empirically, refine measurement instruments, and address equitable AI access across diverse healthcare contexts.## ConclusionAI-assisted nursing care holds immense potential to revolutionize nursing by enhancing patient outcomes, efficiency, and nurses\u2019 well-being. This concept analysis, through its systematic exploration of attributes, antecedents, consequences, and referents, provides a robust framework for its understanding and implementation. As healthcare evolves, sustained efforts in education, research, and ethical governance will ensure AI augments nursing practice effectively, preserving the profession\u2019s core focus on compassionate, high-quality care.## Data availabilityNo datasets were generated or analysed during the current study.## AbbreviationsAI:: Artificial IntelligencePRISMA:: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-AnalysesEHR:: Electronic Health Record## References1.

But most models today only consider a few specific types of data or variables. Compare that with human scientists, who work in a collaborative environment and consider experimental results, the broader scientific literature, imaging and structural analysis, personal experience or intuition, and input from colleagues and peer reviewers.Now, MIT researchers have developed a method for optimizing materials recipes and planning experiments that incorporates information from diverse sources like insights from the literature, chemical compositions, microstructural images, and more. The approach is part of a new platform, named Copilot for Real-world Experimental Scientists (CRESt), that also uses robotic equipment for high-throughput materials testing, the results of which are fed back into large multimodal models to further optimize materials recipes.Human researchers can converse with the system in natural language, with no coding required, and the system makes its own observations and hypotheses along the way. Cameras and visual language models also allow the system to monitor experiments, detect issues, and suggest corrections.\u201cIn the field of AI for science, the key is designing new experiments,\u201d says Ju Li, School of Engineering Carl Richard Soderberg Professor of Power Engineering. \u201cWe use multimodal feedback \u2014 for example information from previous literature on how palladium behaved in fuel cells at this temperature, and human feedback \u2014 to complement experimental data and design new experiments. We also use robots to synthesize and characterize the material\u2019s structure and to test performance.\u201dThe system is described in a paper published in *Nature*. The researchers used CRESt to explore more than 900 chemistries and conduct 3,500 electrochemical tests, leading to the discovery of a catalyst material that delivered record power density in a fuel cell that runs on formate salt to produce electricity.Joining Li on the paper as first authors are PhD student Zhen Zhang, Zhichu Ren PhD \u201924, PhD student Chia-Wei Hsu, and postdoc Weibin Chen.

They require researchers to carefully design workflows, make new material, and run a series of tests and analysis to understand what happened. Those results are then used to decide how to improve the material.To improve the process, some researchers have turned to a machine-learning strategy known as active learning to make efficient use of previous experimental data points and explore or exploit those data. When paired with a statistical technique known as Bayesian optimization (BO), active learning has helped researchers identify new materials for things like batteries and advanced semiconductors.\u201cBayesian optimization is like Netflix recommending the next movie to watch based on your viewing history, except instead it recommends the next experiment to do,\u201d Li explains. \u201cBut basic Bayesian optimization is too simplistic. It uses a boxed-in design space, so if I say I\u2019m going to use platinum, palladium, and iron, it only changes the ratio of those elements in this small space. But real materials have a lot more dependencies, and BO often gets lost.\u201dMost active learning approaches also rely on single data streams that don\u2019t capture everything that goes on in an experiment. To equip computational systems with more human-like knowledge, while still taking advantage of the speed and control of automated systems, Li and his collaborators built CRESt.CRESt\u2019s robotic equipment includes a liquid-handling robot, a carbothermal shock system to rapidly synthesize materials, an automated electrochemical workstation for testing, characterization equipment including automated electron microscopy and optical microscopy, and auxiliary devices such as pumps and gas valves, which can also be remotely controlled. Many processing parameters can also be tuned.With the user interface, researchers can chat with CRESt and tell it to use active learning to find promising materials recipes for different projects. CRESt can include up to 20 precursor molecules and substrates into its recipe. To guide material designs, CRESt\u2019s models search through scientific papers for descriptions of elements or precursor molecules that might be useful. When human researchers tell CRESt to pursue new recipes, it kicks off a robotic symphony of sample preparation, characterization, and testing. The researcher can also ask CRESt to perform image analysis from scanning electron microscopy imaging, X-ray diffraction, and other sources.Information from those processes is used to train the active learning models, which use both literature knowledge and current experimental results to suggest further experiments and accelerate materials discovery.\u201cFor each recipe we use previous literature text or databases, and it creates these huge representations of every recipe based on the previous knowledge base before even doing the experiment,\u201d says Li. \u201cWe perform principal component analysis in this knowledge embedding space to get a reduced search space that captures most of the performance variability. Then we use Bayesian optimization in this reduced space to design the new experiment. After the new experiment, we feed newly acquired multimodal experimental data and human feedback into a large language model to augment the knowledgebase and redefine the reduced search space, which gives us a big boost in active learning efficiency.\u201dMaterials science experiments can also face reproducibility challenges. To address the problem, CRESt monitors its experiments with cameras, looking for potential problems and suggesting solutions via text and voice to human researchers.The researchers used CRESt to develop an electrode material for an advanced type of high-density fuel cell known as a direct formate fuel cell. After exploring more than 900 chemistries over three months, CRESt discovered a catalyst material made from eight elements that achieved a 9.3-fold improvement in power density per dollar over pure palladium, an expensive precious metal. In further tests, CRESTs material was used to deliver a record power density to a working direct formate fuel cell even though the cell contained just one-fourth of the precious metals of previous devices.The results show the potential for CRESt to find solutions to real-world energy problems that have plagued the materials science and engineering community for decades.\u201cA significant challenge for fuel-cell catalysts is the use of precious metal,\u201d says Zhang. \u201cFor fuel cells, researchers have used various precious metals like palladium and platinum. We used a multielement catalyst that also incorporates many other cheap elements to create the optimal coordination environment for catalytic activity and resistance to poisoning species such as carbon monoxide and adsorbed hydrogen atom. People have been searching low-cost options for many years. This system greatly accelerated our search for these catalysts.\u201d**A helpful assistant**Early on, poor reproducibility emerged as a major problem that limited the researchers\u2019 ability to perform their new active learning technique on experimental datasets. Material properties can be influenced by the way the precursors are mixed and processed, and any number of problems can subtly alter experimental conditions, requiring careful inspection to correct.To partially automate the process, the researchers coupled computer vision and vision language models with domain knowledge from the scientific literature, which allowed the system to hypothesize sources of irreproducibility and propose solutions. For example, the models can notice when there\u2019s a millimeter-sized deviation in a sample\u2019s shape or when a pipette moves something out of place. The researchers incorporated some of the model\u2019s suggestions, leading to improved consistency, suggesting the models already make good experimental assistants.The researchers noted that humans still performed most of the debugging in their experiments.\u201cCREST is an assistant, not a replacement, for human researchers,\u201d Li says. \u201cHuman researchers are still indispensable. In fact, we use natural language so the system can explain what it is doing and present observations and hypotheses. But this is a step toward more flexible, self-driving labs.\u201d### Share this news article on:- X- Facebook- LinkedIn- Reddit- [Print](#)## PaperPaper: \u201cA multimodal robotic platform for multi-element electrocatalyst discovery\u201dCheck for open access version(s) of the research mentioned in this article.## Related Links- Ju Li- Department of Materials Science and Engineering- Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering- School of Engineering## Related Topics- [Research](/topic/research)- [Materials science and engineering](/topic/materialsscienceandengineering)- [Energy](/topic/energy)- [Artificial intelligence](/topic/artificial-intelligence2)- [Machine learning](/topic/machine-learning)- [Nanoscience and nanotechnology](/topic/nanotech)- [DMSE](/topic/dmse)- [Nuclear science and engineering](/topic/nuclear-engineering)- [MIT.nano](/topic/mitnano)- [School of Engineering](/topic/school-engineering)## Related Articles[![A green, glowing ammonia molecule in rock.
