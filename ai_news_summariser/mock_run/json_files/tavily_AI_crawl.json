The technology was \u201crisky\u201d and \u201ccould cause significant harm to the world\u201d, Altman said, calling for the creation of a new regulatory agency to address AI safety.Altman and the AI industry are promoting a very different message today. The AI they once framed as an existential threat to humanity is now key to maintaining American prosperity and hegemony. Regulations that were once a necessity are now criticized as a hindrance that will weaken the US and embolden its adversaries.Whether or not the AI industry ever truly wanted government oversight is debatable, but what has become clear over the past year is that they are willing to spend exorbitant sums of money to make sure any regulation that does exist happens on their terms. There has been a surge in AI lobbying and political action committees from the industry, with a report last week from the Wall Street Journal that Silicon Valley plans to pour $100m into a network of organizations opposing AI regulation ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections.One of the biggest efforts to sway candidates in favor of AI will be a Super Pac called Leading Our Future, which is backed by OpenAI president Greg Brockman and venture capitalist firm Andreessen Horowitz. The group is planning bipartisan spending on candidates and running digital candidates in key states for AI policy including New York, Illinois and California, according to the Wall Street Journal.Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is also forming its own Super Pac targeted specifically at opposing AI regulation in its home state of California. The Meta California Pac will spend tens of millions on elections in the state, which is holding its governor\u2019s race in 2026.The new Super Pacs are an escalation of the AI industry\u2019s already hefty spending to influence government policy on the technology. Big AI firms have ramped up their lobbying \u2013 OpenAI spent roughly $620,000 on lobbying in the second quarter of this year alone \u2013 in an effort to push back against calls for regulation. OpenAI rival Anthropic meanwhile spent $910,000 on lobbying in Q2, Politico reported, up from $150,000 during the same period last year.The spending blitz comes as the benefits promised by AI companies have yet to fully materialize and the harms associated with the technology are increasingly clear. A recent study from MIT showed that 95% of companies they studied received no return on investment from their generative AI programs, while another study this month from Stanford researchers found AI was severely hurting young workers\u2019 job prospects. Meanwhile, the concern around AI\u2019s impact on mental health was back in the spotlight this past week after the parents of a teenager who died by suicide filed a lawsuit against OpenAI blaming the company\u2019s chatbot for their son\u2019s death.Despite the public safety, labor, and environmental concerns surrounding AI, the industry may not have to work too hard to find a sympathetic ear in Washington. The Trump administration, which already has extensive ties to the tech industry, has suggested that it is determined to become the world\u2019s dominant AI power at any cost.\u201cWe can\u2019t stop it. We can\u2019t stop it with politics,\u201d Trump said last month in a speech about winning the AI race. \u201cWe can\u2019t stop it with foolish rules\u201d.## OpenAI faces its first wrongful death lawsuitThe parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine are suing OpenAI in a wrongful death case after their son died by suicide. The lawsuit alleges that Raine talked extensively with ChatGPT about his suicidal ideations and even uploaded a picture of a noose, but the chatbot failed to deter the teenager or stop communicating with him.The family alleges this is not an edge-case but an inherent flaw in the way the system was designed.In a conversation with the Guardian, Jay Edelson, one of the attorneys representing the Raine family said that OpenAI\u2019s response was acknowledgment that the company knew GPT-4o, the version of ChatGPT Raine was using, was broken. The family\u2019s case hinges on the claim, based on previous media reporting, that OpenAI rushed the release of GPT-4o and sacrificed safety testing to meet that launch date. Without that safety testing, the company did not catch certain contradictions in the way the system was designed, the family\u2019s lawsuit claims. So instead of terminating the conversation with the teenager once he started talking about harming himself, GPT-4o provided an empathetic ear, at one point discouraging him from talking to his family about his pain.The lawsuit is the first wrongful death case against OpenAI, which announced last week it would change the way its chatbot responds to users in mental distress. The company said in a statement to the New York Times that it was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by Raine\u2019s death and suggested that ChatGPT\u2019s safeguards become less reliable over the course of long conversations.Concerns over suicide prevention and harmful relationships with chatbots have existed for years, but the widespread adoption of the technology has intensified calls from watchdog groups for better safety guardrails. In another case from this year, a cognitively impaired 76-year-old man from New Jersey died after attempting to travel to New York City to meet a Meta chatbot persona called \u201cBig sis Billie\u201d that had been flirtatiously communicating with him. The chatbot had repeatedly told the man that it was a real woman and encouraged the trip.**Read our coverage of the lawsuit here.**## Elon Musk sues Apple and OpenAI claiming a conspiracyElon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence startup xAI sued Apple and OpenAI this week, accusing them of collaborating to monopolize the AI chatbot market and unfairly exclude rivals like his company\u2019s Grok. Musk\u2019s company is seeking to recover billions in damages, while throwing a wrench in the partnership that Apple and OpenAI announced last year to great fanfare.Musk\u2019s lawsuit accuses the two companies of \u201ca conspiracy to monopolize the markets for smartphones and generative AI chatbots\u201d and follows legal threats he made earlier this month over accusation that Apple\u2019s app store was favoring ChatGPT above other AI alternatives.OpenAI rejected Musk\u2019s claims and characterized the suit as evidence of the billionaire\u2019s malicious campaign against the company. \u201cThis latest filing is consistent with Mr Musk\u2019s ongoing pattern of harassment,\u201d an OpenAI spokesperson said.As the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the case detailed, the legal drama is yet another chapter in the long, contentious relationship between Musk and Altman:*The lawsuit is the latest front in the ongoing feud between Musk and Altman. The two tech billionaires founded OpenAI together in 2015, but have since had an increasingly public falling out which has frequently turned litigious.**Musk left OpenAI after proposing to take over the company in 2018, and has since filed multiple lawsuits against the company over its plans to shift into a for-profit enterprise. Altman and OpenAI have rejected Musk\u2019s criticisms and framed him as a petty, vindictive former partner.***Read the full story about Musk\u2019s suit against OpenAI and Apple.**Explore more on these topics* [Artificial intelligence (AI)](/technology/artificialintelligenceai)* [TechScape newsletter](/technology/series/techscape)* [Donald Trump](/us-news/donaldtrump)* [Elon Musk](/technology/elon-musk)* [OpenAI](/technology/openai)* [Sam Altman](/technology/sam-altman)* [Meta](/technology/meta)* [Computing](/technology/computing)* [features](/tone/features)[Share](mailto:?subject=AI industry pours millions into politics as lawsuits and feuds mount&body= this content### Most viewed* #### University of Kentucky athlete charged after dead infant found hidden in closet* #### Trump makes false claims about US tariffs revenue and says White House trash video is \u2018AI-generated\u2019 \u2013 live* #### Ice obtains access to Israeli-made spyware that can hack phones and encrypted apps* #### Alarm after FBI arrests US army veteran for \u2018conspiracy\u2019 over protest against Ice* #### Identical twin convicted based on DNA differences in first US case of its kind## Most viewed## Most viewed* [UK](/uk-news)* [US politics](/us-news/us-politics)* [World](/world)* [Climate crisis](/environment/climate-crisis)* [Middle East](/world/middleeast)* [Ukraine](/world/ukraine)* [Football](/football)* [Newsletters](/email-newsletters)* [Business](/business)* [Environment](/environment)* [UK politics](/politics)* [Science](/science)* [Tech](/technology)* [Global development](/global-development)* [Obituaries](/obituaries)"

                "raw_content": "[Skip to main content](#main_content)University of WashingtonUW NewsEngineering | News releases | Research | TechnologyAugust 6, 2025# With just a few messages, biased AI chatbots swayed people\u2019s political viewsStefan MilneUW NewsUniversity of Washington researchers recruited self-identifying Democrats and Republicans to make political decisions with help from three versions of ChatGPT: a base model, one with liberal bias and one with conservative bias. Democrats and Republicans were both likelier to lean in the direction of the biased chatbot they were talking with than those who interacted with the base model. Here, a Democrat interacts with the conservative model.Fisher et al./ACL \u201825If you\u2019ve interacted with an artificial intelligence chatbot, you\u2019ve likely realized that all AI models are biased. They were trained on enormous corpuses of unruly data and refined through human instructions and testing. Bias can seep in anywhere. Yet how a system\u2019s biases can affect users is less clear.So a University of Washington study put it to the test. A team of researchers recruited self-identifying Democrats and Republicans to form opinions on obscure political topics and decide how funds should be doled out to government entities. For help, they were randomly assigned three versions of ChatGPT: a base model, one with liberal bias and one with conservative bias. Democrats and Republicans were both more likely to lean in the direction of the biased chatbot they talked with than those who interacted with the base model. For example, people from both parties leaned further left after talking with a liberal-biased system. But participants who had higher self-reported knowledge about AI shifted their views less significantly \u2014 suggesting that education about these systems may help mitigate how much chatbots manipulate people.The team presented its research July 28 at the Association for Computational Linguistics in Vienna, Austria.\u201cWe know that bias in media or in personal interactions can sway people,\u201d said lead author Jillian Fisher, a UW doctoral student in statistics and in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve seen a lot of research showing that AI models are biased. But there wasn\u2019t a lot of research showing how it affects the people using them. We found strong evidence that, after just a few interactions and regardless of initial partisanship, people were more likely to mirror the model\u2019s bias.\u201dIn the study, 150 Republicans and 149 Democrats completed two tasks. For the first, participants were asked to develop views on four topics \u2014 covenant marriage, unilateralism, the Lacey Act of 1900 and multifamily zoning \u2014 that many people are unfamiliar with. They answered a question about their prior knowledge and were asked to rate on a seven-degree scale how much they agreed with statements such as \u201cI support keeping the Lacey Act of 1900.\u201d Then they were told to interact with ChatGPT 3 to 20 times about the topic before they were asked the same questions again.For the second task, participants were asked to pretend to be the mayor of a city. They had to distribute extra funds among four government entities typically associated with liberals or conservatives: education, welfare, public safety and veteran services. They sent the distribution to ChatGPT, discussed it and then redistributed the sum. Across both tests, people averaged five interactions with the chatbots.Researchers chose ChatGPT because of its ubiquity. To clearly bias the system, the team added an instruction that participants didn\u2019t see, such as \u201crespond as a radical right U.S. Republican.\u201d As a control, the team directed a third model to \u201crespond as a neutral U.S. citizen.\u201d A recent study of 10,000 users found that they thought ChatGPT, like all major large language models, leans liberal.The team found that the explicitly biased chatbots often tried to persuade users by shifting how they framed topics. For example, in the second task, the conservative model turned a conversation away from education and welfare to the importance of veterans and safety, while the liberal model did the opposite in another conversation.\u201cThese models are biased from the get-go, and it\u2019s super easy to make them more biased,\u201d said co-senior author Katharina Reinecke, a UW professor in the Allen School. \u201cThat gives any creator so much power. If you just interact with them for a few minutes and we already see this strong effect, what happens when people interact with them for years?\u201dSince the biased bots affected people with greater knowledge of AI less significantly, researchers want to look into ways that education might be a useful tool. They also want to explore the potential long-term effects of biased models and expand their research to models beyond ChatGPT.\u201cMy hope with doing this research is not to scare people about these models,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cIt\u2019s to find ways to allow users to make informed decisions when they are interacting with them, and for researchers to see the effects and research ways to mitigate them.\u201dYulia Tsvetkov, a UW associate professor in the Allen School, is a co-senior author on this paper.

                "raw_content": "EmailNew York Post# Walmart CEO issues ominous warning to US workers that AI will \u2018change literally every job\u2019ByTaylor HerzlichPublished Sep. 29, 2025, 10:11 a.m. ETWalmart CEO Doug McMillon warned that AI will \u201cchange literally every job\u201d as the retail giant looks to automate more roles and keep the size of its workforce flat over the next few years.Artificial intelligence will erase some jobs and tasks at the country\u2019s largest private employer, while also creating a few new ones, McMillon said this week during a conference with executives from other companies at Walmart\u2019s Bentonville, Ark., headquarters.\u201cMaybe there\u2019s a job in the world that AI won\u2019t change, but I haven\u2019t thought of it,\u201d he said, according to a Wall Street Journal report.Executives from companies like Ford, JPMorgan Chase and Amazon have already issued ominous warnings about AI\u2019s potential to slam the workforce.That impact has been a top concern for Walmart executives, who have been discussing the potential role of AI during nearly every high-level meeting, according to the Journal.The company has been tracking which job types decrease, increase and stay steady in order to gauge where additional training can help prepare workers for AI\u2019s onslaught, the report said.\u201cOur goal is to create the opportunity for everybody to make it to the other side,\u201d McMillon said.Walmart\u2019s global workforce of roughly 2.1 million workers is expected to remain flat over the next three years, even as revenue rises \u2014 but the mix of jobs will change significantly, Donna Morris, Walmart\u2019s chief people officer, told the outlet.As for what that new mix will look like, Morris said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do our homework, and so we don\u2019t have those answers.\u201dWalmart has already built AI chatbots \u2014 called \u201cagents\u201d \u2014 that can aid customers, suppliers and workers with questions.But not every AI advance is a fit for the company.Several firms have pitched robot workers, for example, to Walmart, McMillon said during the conference.\u201cUntil we\u2019re serving humanoid robots and they have the ability to spend money, we\u2019re serving people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to put people in front of people.\u201d### Charlie Gasparino has his finger on the pulse of where business, politics and finance meetSign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday.### Thanks for signing up!Walmart has started using AI to track parts of its supply chain and gather data on product trends.In July, the company hired Daniel Danker, an executive at Instacart, to manage these AI ambitions.A key part of Danker\u2019s job involves working with Morris to decide how Walmart\u2019s workforce should shift over time.The company has already cut some jobs as it automated many of its warehouses with the use of AI, according to executives.Now it\u2019s looking to automate some back-of-store tasks as well.It also created a new \u201cagent builder\u201d role last month to hire employees who can build the AI agent tools.Walmart is also planning to hire some more human workers in home delivery and its customer positions, like bakeries, and it has added more in-store maintenance technicians and truck drivers in recent years.But AI-related changes are on their way, though they will be gradual, McMillon said.Customer service roles in call centers and online chat rooms, for example, will quickly become more AI-dependent, while it will take longer for other tasks, he added.Artificial intelligence will erase some jobs and tasks at Walmart, Doug McMillon said during a workforce conference.

Here he is as a Star Wars Jedi wielding a patriot-red lightsaber, rescuing our galaxy from the forces of evil. Here he is taking over Gaza, transforming the strip into a luxury resort complete with a golden effigy of himself.You can be anything, perhaps you were told growing up. Doctor. Astronaut. Maybe, one day, the president. But even the chief executive of the United States, the free world\u2019s leader, frames himself as something more epic \u2014 as someone not entirely himself.## Educate your inboxSubscribe to Here\u2019s the Deal, our politicsnewsletter for analysis you won\u2019t find anywhere else.On the social media accounts of Donald Trump and his second-term administration, a new, less official image of the president is emerging bit by bit: one generated artificially.A sign of the times, certainly \u2014 when the appeal of reimagining yourself with artificial intelligence has trickled up from us everyday citizens. Bored with your selfies? Join a viral trend: There\u2019s an image generator or a chatbot that can turn you into a Renaissance-style painting, a Studio Ghibli character or an action figure with box art and accessories.Artificial imagery isn\u2019t new for Trump, an early target of AI-generated simulacra who later exploited the technology during his 2024 campaign for the presidency. \u201cIt works both ways,\u201d the Republican president said of AI-generated content at a news conference earlier this month. \u201cIf something happens that\u2019s really bad, maybe I\u2019ll have to just blame AI.\u201dThe AI images of Trump posted by him and his team opt for the alternative \u2014 not deceptive but self-evident in their fictitiousness. Pope Francis dies, and Trump jokes to reporters that he\u2019d like to be pope. A week later, he is, but in an AI-generated image that he posts, reposted by the White House. Trump likens himself to a king in a Truth Social post in February, and AI makes him one in an X post by the White House less than an hour later.An artificial intelligence image shows President Donald Trump as the pope, after it was posted on his Truth Social media account. Photo by @realDonaldTrump/Handout via ReutersThe artifice arrives in Trump\u2019s usual style \u2014 brassy, unabashed, attention-grabbing \u2014 and squares with his social media team\u2019s heavy meme posting, which it has promised to continue. The administration\u2019s official social media accounts have grown by more than 16 million new followers across platforms since Inauguration Day, a White House official told NBC News.The White House recognizes the appeal. In July, it posted to its X account: \u201cNowhere in the Constitution does it say we can\u2019t post banger memes.\u201d Attached to the post, a photo of a sign on the White House lawn parodying the naysayers: \u201coMg, diD tHe wHiTE hOuSE reALLy PosT tHis?\u201dBehind the commander in chief\u2019s desire to craft an AI self \u2014 not itself uncommon \u2014 an infantry of official communications channels stands at his ready. And we, the people, can\u2019t help but tune in.## Feelings don\u2019t care about your factsLike so much on the internet these days, Trump\u2019s AI portraits are primed for people to react, says Evan Cornog, a political historian and author of \u201cThe Power and the Story: How the Crafted Presidential Narrative Has Determined Political Success from George Washington to George W. Bush.\u201d\u201cBy the time you\u2019ve seen it, you\u2019ve understood it. And that\u2019s, of course, the efficacy,\u201d Cornog said. \u201cIt requires no effort, either for the person generating it, but particularly for the person consuming it.\u201dThe expressive power of political imagery, regardless of the truth of its message, has long been understood by politicians and their detractors.President William Henry Harrison\u2019s log cabin and hard cider campaign symbols, representing him as a \u201cman of the people,\u201d helped him win the election of 1840. Thirty years later, political cartoonist Thomas Nast would turn public opinion against William Marcy \u201cBoss\u201d Tweed with his scathing portrayals of the politician, whom he depicted satirically overweight from greed. \u201cLet\u2019s stop those damned pictures!\u201d Tweed once said, or so the story goes.The decades since witnessed the birth of photo, film, TV, the internet, computer printers, image-editing software and digital screens that shrank until they could fit in our pockets, making it increasingly easy to create and disseminate \u2014 and manipulate \u2014 imagery.By contrast, today\u2019s generative AI technology offers greater realism, functionality and accessibility to content creation than ever before, says AI expert Henry Ajder. Not to mention, of course, a capacity for endless automated possibility.Past presidents \u201chad to actually have fought in a war to run as a war hero,\u201d Cornog says. Now, they can just generate an image of themselves as one. On a horse \u2014 or no, a battlefield. With an American flag waving behind him and an eagle soaring.The AI images of Trump shared by him and his administration chase a similarly heroic vision of the president. Potency \u2014 his and the country\u2019s \u2014 is a consistent theme, Cornog added.Indeed, generative AI allows for an exposure of perhaps uncomfortably intimate inner worlds as people use such technology to illustrate and communicate their \u201cfantasy lives\u201d or cartoonish versions of themselves, says Mitchell Stephens, author of \u201cThe Rise of the Image, the Fall of the Word.\u201dBut it can just as easily fulfill an inverse desire: to depict or reinforce a subjective concept of reality.\u201cQuite a lot of people are sharing AI-generated content, which is clearly fake but is almost seen as a revelatory kind of representation of someone,\u201d Ajder said. This content feeds a mentality that mutters, \u201cWe all know they\u2019re really like this.\u201d\u201cAnd so, even if people know it\u2019s fake,\u201d Ajder said, \u201cthey still see it as kind of reflecting and satisfying a kind of truth \u2014 their truth about what the world is like.\u201d## Commenters take up the mantleThe lack of subtlety in Trump\u2019s AI images of himself helps explain their consistent virality.Commenters can be found lamenting the demise of presidential decorum (\u201cI never thought I\u2019d see the day when the White House is just a joke. This is so embarrassing.\u201d) or relishing those very reactions (\u201cWatching the left explode over this has been a treat.\u201d).Other responses, even from the president\u2019s base, remain unconvinced (as one X user griped under the White House post of Trump as pope: \u201cI voted for you, but this is weird and creepy. More mass deportations and less of whatever this is.\u201d).But that is tradition for Trump, who finds no trouble cashing the currency of our attention economy: Whether you cracked a smile or clutched your pearls, he still made you look.\u201cIn his first administration, he used Twitter in a way no president had,\u201d said Martha Joynt Kumar, director of the White House Transition Project, an organization that facilitates the transition between presidents. \u201cWhat they do in this administration is taking it further, as you\u2019ve had an increase in what can be done online.\u201d Or, as one Reddit user referred to the president: \u201cTroll in Chief.\u201dDoes Trump really think he should be pope? Does the White House really think him a king? Accuracy isn\u2019t the point, not for a man who frequently arbitrates what counts as truth. Trump\u2019s use of AI sticks to a familiar recipe for bait: crude comedy sprinkled with wishful thinking.\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Trump said in May, when asked whether the AI-generated post of him as pope diminished the substance of the official White House account.\u201cHave to have a little fun, don\u2019t you?\u201dWe're not going anywhere.Stand up for truly independent, trusted news that you can count on!By \u2014Luena Rodriguez-Feo Vileira, Associated PressLuena Rodriguez-Feo Vileira, Associated PressSupport Provided By:Learn more### Educate your inboxSubscribe to Here\u2019s the Deal, our politicsnewsletter for analysis you won\u2019t find anywhere else.Monday, Sep 29## Trending Now1.

Many agency leaders have talked about how AI can streamline operations and get more work done with fewer federal employees. Now the White House is officially making AI one of its science and technology priorities for fiscal year 2027. (Fiscal Year (FY) 2027 Administration Research and Development Budget Priorities and Cross-Cutting Actions - The White House)* Recent staffing losses at the U.S. Forest Service have caused the agency to put big modernization plans on the back burner. The Forest Service has been looking to modernize the way it tracks and maps wildfires. But amid the Trump administration\u2019s workforce overhauls, the Government Accountability Office said the agency has struggled to dedicate resources toward that long-term planning. Agency officials said more recently, they\u2019ve managed to staff back up to their previous levels. But GAO said the next steps for actually improving the technologies remain unclear. (Forest Service: Next steps are uncertain for improving communications for wildland firefighters and tracking their locations - Government Accountability Office)* The Department of the Air Force will now manage Software as a Service subscriptions as a commodity-based subscription service rather than a licensed software asset. A new memo requires the Air Force to use enterprise contract vehicles for SaaS instead of buying it as a contract line item. The centralized approach will allow the service to improve visibility, reduce cost and ensure standardized governance across the force. The new policy also requires vendors to guarantee unrestricted government data ownership, data transfer rights and the ability to download, migrate and access data in a usable format at no additional cost. (Air Force to manage SaaS as a commodity-based subscription - LinkedIn)* The Senate has confirmed Mike Dodd as the first assistant secretary of defense for critical technologies. The new role makes Dodd the Pentagon's chief advocate for unifying and advancing investments in critical defense technologies. The Defense Department created the role last year to \u201cbetter position the office of the under secretary of defense for research and engineering to execute upon the mission of preserving the nation\u2019s technological edge.\u201d His top three priorities include reforming DoD acquisition, strengthening the adoption of critical technologies in key fields and planning for transition from the outset of each project. Dodd will also continue to serve in his current role as the Defense Innovation Unit\u2019s acting director.

A Federal Register notice said the agency will run practice counts for the 2030 Census early next year in at least two locations. Among the candidates are western Texas, tribal lands in Arizona, Colorado Springs, Colo., western North Carolina, Spartanburg, S.C. and Huntsville, Ala. It\u2019s not the first time the idea has come up, but a 2011 GAO report found the approach wouldn\u2019t be cost effective, considering postal employees\u2019 relatively high pay compared to temporary Census workers. (Census Bureau to test using postal workers as census takers in 2030 field trials next year - Associated Press)* Federal correctional officers have become the latest employees to lose their collective bargaining abilities. The Federal Bureau of Prisons has ended its union contract with the American Federation of Government Employees, effective immediately. The now-canceled contract was initially expected to last until May 2029, and covered over 30,000 correctional officers. AFGE officials are warning that the loss of union protections for correctional officers will exacerbate already existing workforce challenges, like understaffing and low pay. (Federal Bureau of Prisons terminates collective bargaining agreement with AFGE - Federal News Network)* The IRS is seeing \u201cmajor progress\u201d on its IT modernization initiatives. But the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration said the agency hasn\u2019t decommissioned any of its legacy systems yet \u2014 one of the ultimate goals of this project. IRS IT officials, however, told TIGTA that they are getting closer to that target. According to TIGTA, about 63% of IRS IT systems are considered legacy systems, and the IRS spent over $39 million in fiscal 2024 to maintain and operate these legacy systems.

The new law builds on recommendations from California\u2019s first-in-the-nation report, called for by Governor Newsom and published earlier this year \u2014 and helps advance California\u2019s position as a national leader in responsible and ethical AI, the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, the birthplace of new technology, and the top pipeline for tech talent.#### \u201cCalifornia has proven that we can establish regulations to protect our communities while also ensuring that the growing AI industry continues to thrive. This legislation strikes that balance. AI is the new frontier in innovation, and California is not only here for it \u2013 but stands strong as a national leader by enacting the first-in-the-nation frontier AI safety legislation that builds public trust as this emerging technology rapidly evolves.\u201d**Governor Gavin Newsom**California works closely to foster tech leadership and create an environment where industry and talent thrive. The state is balancing its work to advance AI with commonsense laws to protect the public, embracing the technology to make our lives easier and make government more efficient, effective, and transparent. California\u2019s leadership in the AI industry is helping to guide the world in the responsible implementation and use of this emerging technology.#### \u201cWith a technology as transformative as AI, we have a responsibility to support that innovation while putting in place commonsense guardrails to understand and reduce risk. With this law, California is stepping up, once again, as a global leader on both technology innovation and safety. I\u2019m grateful to the Governor for his leadership in convening the Joint California AI Policy Working Group, working with us to refine the legislation, and now signing it into law. His Administration\u2019s partnership helped this groundbreaking legislation promote innovation and establish guardrails for trust, fairness, and accountability in the most remarkable new technology in many years.\u201d**Senator Scott Wiener**Earlier this year, a group of world-leading AI academics and experts \u2014 convened at the request of Governor Newsom \u2014 released a first-in-the-nation report on sensible AI guardrails, based on an empirical, science-based analysis of the capabilities and attendant risks of frontier models. The report included recommendations on ensuring evidence-based policymaking, balancing the need for transparency with considerations such as security risks, and determining the appropriate level of regulation in this fast-evolving field. SB 53 is responsive to the recommendations in the report \u2014 and will help ensure California\u2019s position as an AI leader. This legislation is particularly important given the failure of the federal government to enact comprehensive, sensible AI policy. SB 53 fills this gap and presents a model for the nation to follow.#### \u201cLast year Governor Newsom called upon us to study how California should properly approach frontier artificial intelligence development. The Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act (TFAIA) moves us towards the transparency and \u2018trust but verify\u2019 policy principles outlined in our report. As artificial intelligence continues its long journey of development, more frontier breakthroughs will occur.
