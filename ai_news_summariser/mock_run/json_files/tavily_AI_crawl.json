Despite widespread piloting, a critical \"learning gap\" prevents systems from adapting, leading to no measurable profit or loss impact.A recent study claimed that 95% of organizations are getting zero return, despite $30\u201340 billion in enterprise investment into GenAI. The study was conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where it surveyed 300 AI deployments while the researchers spoke to approximately 350 employees. As per the study, the reason behind failure of investment on AI is because of the \u201clearning gap\u201d. \u201cThe core barrier to scaling is not infrastructure, regulation, or talent. It is learning. Most GenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time,\u201d the study highlighted.MIT published a report titled The GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025, which said that only 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable P&L (profit & loss) impact. The study says that more than 80 % of organizations have explored or piloted tools like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Microsoft\u2019s Copilot. Nearly 40% reported deployment of these tools. However, these AI tools, as per the study, enhance individual productivity primarily with no P&L performance. \u201cMost fail due to brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, and misalignment with day-to-day operations,\u201d the study highlighted.It said that sixty percent of organizations evaluated such AI tools, but only 20 percent reached pilot stage and just 5 percent reached production. Meanwhile, enterprise-grade systems, custom or vendor-sold, are being quietly rejected, the report added.## Patterns defining GenAI divideThe study found four patterns that define the GenAI Divide:* **Limited disruption:** Only 2 of 8 major sectors show meaningful structural change* **Enterprise paradox:** Big firms lead in pilot volume but lag in scale-up* **Investment bias:** Budgets favor visible, top-line functions over high-ROI back office* **Implementation advantage:** External partnerships see twice the success rate of internal builds**About the Author**TOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.
