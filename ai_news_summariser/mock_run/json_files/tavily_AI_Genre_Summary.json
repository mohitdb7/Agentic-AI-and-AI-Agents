We concluded that *P**atience is warranted as is being selective in investing, but if AI lives up to expectations and enthusiasm, it will generate tremendous value and wealth for companies and investors for years to come. In August, Morgan Stanley reported that the U.S. AI market is expected to reach $1.5 trillion by 2025. The U.K. is the only country in the world that has not seen a rise in the number of jobs created by Gen AI. Morgan Stanley predicts that by the end of the next decade, there will be 1.5 million Gen AI jobs in the United States."

It can serve humanity by advancing education, revolutionizing healthcare and improving quality of life across the globe. But it can also intensify conflicts, reshape military operations and raise serious ethical concerns when used as a weapon of war. The balance between these two realities will define how this technology shapes the future of our world, say the authors of the book. The book is published by Oxford University Press and is published in the U.S. by Simon & Schuster, a division of Penguin Random House. The author\u2019s name is Dr. Majid Rafizadeh and the book is \u2018Artificial Intelligence: The Future of War\u2019."
