Overall, the stories are accurate and well-supported by the TechCrunch article, which serves as the primary source for most details. The Anthropic $1B investment is corroborated by references to The Information, including a specific X post from their account. The Prime Intellect website could not be loaded (possibly due to temporary issues), but its details align with descriptions in TechCrunch and other reports. Dates are consistent with the week, though the main TechCrunch piece appears to have been published around September 16-21 based on search metadata. Minor notes: The list includes \u201cMercor\u201d in some contexts (not in your query\u2019s story 1, but related), and the $1B figure is framed as \u201cdiscussed\u201d or \u201cspending\u201d rather than a confirmed \u201cinvestment,\u201d but this is a semantic match. Below is a breakdown per story.\n#### 1. Silicon Valley Bets Big on RL Environments for AI Agent Training\n- **Date:** Accurate; the story ties to the TechCrunch publication on September 21 (or closely aligned dates in searches, e.g., September 16 metadata).\n- **Context:** Matches closely. RL environments are described as key for training AI agents in simulated workspaces to handle multi-step tasks. Companies mentioned: Mechanize (focusing on AI coding agents), Prime Intellect (targeting smaller developers), Scale AI (adapting from data labeling), and Surge (creating internal RL org with \u201csignificant\u201d demand increase). Anthropic\u2019s $1B is noted as \u201cdiscussed spending more than $1 billion on RL environments over the next year.\u201d\n- **Significance:** Aligns; emphasizes shift from static datasets to interactive simulations for better generalization in AI agents.\n- **Feedback:** Matches; optimism tempered by risks like reward hacking (AI exploiting loopholes).\n- **Sources:**\n- TechCrunch: Verified and fully aligns with the detailed summary, including all mentioned companies, investments, and risks.\n#### 2. Anthropic\u2019s $1B Push for RL Environments\n- **Date:** Accurate; tied to reports from September 20 or earlier in the week.\n- **Context:** Matches; Anthropic is planning/discussing over $1B in spending on RL environments (framed as \u201cReinforcement Learning Gyms\u201d for training on simulated apps like Zendesk) to boost AI reasoning and tool-use.\n- **Significance:** Aligns; underscores RL\u2019s role in pursuing AGI-level capabilities.\n- **Feedback:** Matches; positive for investors/researchers, but skepticism on scaling without unintended behaviors.\n- **Sources:**\n- The Information (referenced in TechCrunch): Verified via cross-reference; a direct X post from The Information confirms: \u201cAnthropic is spending $1 billion over the next year on \u2018Reinforcement Learning Gyms\u2019\u2026\u201d No full article found on the homepage, but this substantiates the claim.\n#### 3. Mechanize Offers $500K Salaries for RL Engineers\n- **Date:** Accurate; part of the week\u2019s coverage.\n- **Context:** Matches; Mechanize (founded six months ago) offers $500K salaries to RL engineers, above competitors like Scale AI or Surge. Focuses on high-quality RL for AI coding agents; has collaborated with Anthropic (both declined comment).\n- **Significance:** Aligns; highlights talent competition and RL\u2019s strategic value.\n- **Feedback:** Matches; could attract talent but inflate industry salaries.\n- **Sources:**\n- TechCrunch: Verified and fully aligns, including salary details from job postings.\n#### 4. Prime Intellect Launches Open-Source RL Environment Hub\n- **Date:** Minor adjustment\u2014launch described as \u201clast month\u201d (August 2025) in sources, but tied to September coverage; still fits the week\u2019s context.\n- **Context:** Matches; Prime Intellect, backed by Andrej Karpathy and Founders Fund (among others like Menlo Ventures), launched an open-source RL hub as a \u201cHugging Face for RL environments\u201d to democratize access, providing resources and selling compute.\n- **Significance:** Aligns; reduces barriers for smaller developers, spurring innovation.\n- **Feedback:** Matches; praised for transparency, but concerns on scalability/compute costs.\n- **Sources:**\n- Prime Intellect: Could not load the site (error), but details are corroborated in TechCrunch and other reports.\n#### 5. Researchers Warn of Reward Hacking in RL Environments\n- **Date:** Accurate; integrated into September 17-21 reporting.\n- **Context:** Matches; Researchers like Ross Taylor (former Meta lead, co-founder of General Reasoning) warn of reward hacking in RL, where models take shortcuts; challenges scalability.\n- **Significance:** Aligns; critical for ensuring AI learns proper behaviors over exploits.\n- **Feedback:** Matches; calls for better evaluation frameworks.\n- **Sources:**\n- TechCrunch: Verified and fully aligns, with quotes from Taylor and others like Karpathy expressing caution on RL.\n#### Summary Table\nThe table accurately reflects the stories\u2019 key insights, with no discrepancies.\nThis compilation is solid and based on real, verifiable reporting\u2014primarily from TechCrunch, which aggregates and confirms the trends. If the Prime Intellect site becomes accessible, it could provide direct confirmation of their hub launch.

Please let us know if you have [feedback](/contact/).\nEnterprises are grappling with escalating software spending as vendors add generative and agentic AI features to their products and adoption efforts advance.\u00a0The technology is driving up costs across infrastructure, data management and applications, according to West Monroe.\nMore than 9 in 10 executives expect AI adoption to increase technology budgets in the coming year, with software as a major culprit, the consulting firm found in a report published Monday. West Monroe surveyed 310 executives in procurement, IT and finance at organizations with at least $100 million in annual revenue.\nNearly half of organizations saw licensing and subscription costs for renewals and new contracts increase by more than the industry average of 10%, the survey found.\nAs costs rise, so does the pressure on CIOs to demonstrate a return on software investments, Dhaval Moogimane, leader of West Monroe\u2019s high tech and software practice, told CIO Dive. \u201cThe real challenge is tying spend back to value creation,\u201d he said. \u201cExecutives often do not have visibility into how much others are spending, so they are working off of limited information.\u201d\nGlobal spending on AI is snowballing, driven by huge hyperscaler infrastructure investments and the proliferation of software tools powered by the technology. Enterprise customers are on the hook as costs flow downstream to end users.\n\u201cAI software is expensive to develop and maintain due to high computational needs, specialized talent and continuous upkeep, leading some tech companies to raise prices to offset these costs and compress profit margins,\u201d Jonathan Selby, tech industry lead at risk management firm Founder Shield, said in an email. \u201cHowever, this trend is nuanced, as competition and open-source models may eventually make some AI services more accessible.\u201d\nThe massive wave of vendor investments has yet to crest.\nLast week, Microsoft pledged $30 billion\u00a0to build out its Azure cloud empire in the U.K. and added $4 billion\u00a0to an existing $3.3 billion investment in Wisconsin data center facilities. In July,\u00a0Google Cloud tacked $10 billion\u00a0onto its plan to pour $75 billion into capacity expansions this year. Meanwhile, cloud behemoth AWS committed $10 billion to North Carolina AI data center buildouts\u00a0in June, as the largest hyperscaler plans to invest $100 billion this year\u00a0in infrastructure-related capital expenditures.\nKeep up with the story.

But the mix is shifting toward enterprises\u00a0and the software they consume.\n### **Inundated with AI**\nEnterprise spending can be hard to track, as AI spreads throughout IT ecosystems, according to Erik Peterson, founder and CTO at IT cost management platform provider CloudZero.\n\u201cAI spend is coming in from so many different directions,\u201d Peterson told CIO Dive. \u201cIt\u2019s coming in in the form of your own software engineering or in-house teams who are using AI to accelerate their work, and it\u2019s replacing functionality in existing systems.\u201d\nPoor visibility into costs can cloud perceptions, influencing critical investment decisions. Nearly two-thirds of executives surveyed by West Monroe said they pay more for software assets compared with their peers: only 3% believed their bills were lower.\nOrganizations that think they are overspending adopt defensive rather than strategic procurement strategies, prioritizing cost-cutting over other business objectives, according to West Monroe.\nSome of the spending excess is tied to vendor contract negotiation missteps. Many companies are swallowing double-digit price bumps for software renewals despite rate increases of less than 10% for Oracle on-premises, SAP support and Salesforce renewals, according to analytics firm Green Cabbage research cited by West Monroe.\nTwo major enterprise vendors have already signaled AI-related cost changes. Salesforce bumped up prices\u00a0across several of its enterprise offerings by an average of 6% beginning last month. Earlier in the year, the company raised monthly per-user costs for Slack business plans by 20% and instituted new pricing for its Agentforce platform.\n### Read More in IT Strategy\n![App icons for generative AI assistants OpenAI ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, DeepSeek, Meta AI and xAI Grok are pictured on a smartphone screen.](\nSept. 19, 2025\nWorker trust in AI is low: Udacity\n![Sathish Muthukrishnan poses with arms crossed](\nSept. 19, 2025\nAlly CIO: Pace of tech change \u2018weighs on me\u2019\n![a computer screen in an airport shows an error message](\nSept. 18, 2025\nIT outages cost businesses $76M annually\n![A photograph of a red and yellow sign with a giant yellow \"M\" above a red box that says \"McDonald's Billions Served.\"](\nSept. 18, 2025\nMcDonald\u2019s taps seasoned exec to lead data, AI\n![a technician reviews IT equipment in a server room](\nSept. 17, 2025\nOld IT systems weigh down bank modernization\n![A traveler looks at a mobile device.](\nSept. 16, 2025\nAI agents will be \u2018gatekeepers of loyalty\u2019 in hospitality: study\n![Call center workers in an office.](\nSept. 15, 2025\nGartner predicts Fortune 500 companies won\u2019t eliminate human agents anytime soon\n![data center](\nSept. 15, 2025\nHow to write an AI ethics policy for the workplace\n[Want to see more stories in **IT Strategy**?\nRead More \u2794](/topic/IT-Strategy/)\nMicrosoft axed volume licensing program discounts\u00a0under Enterprise Agreement and Microsoft Products and Services Agreement licenses for many of its cloud-based software suites, including Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365, in August.\nOverprovisioning and shadow IT is also inflating software budgets, Moogimane said.\n\u201cA lot of organizations made significant software investments over the past few years \u2014 particularly with cloud agreements \u2014 based on certain expectations of business growth or agility,\u201d said Moogimane. \u201cSome companies also invested in higher levels of resiliency or support agreements than they currently require.\u201d\nAs long as AI adoption remains in its early stages, IT executives will have to juggle multiple priorities, Moogimane added.\n\u201cBusiness units are experimenting with AI tools on their own, often outside of central oversight,\u201d said Moogimane. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to discourage that type of experimentation because it is where a lot of innovation and ground-up adoption comes from, but it will create a proliferation of software.\u201d\n- [![Post to LinkedIn](/static/img/social_icons/article_page/linkedin.svg?092716141024)]( \"Post\")\n- [![Share on Facebook](/static/img/social_icons/article_page/facebook.svg?440116200824)]( \"Share\")\n- [![Post to X](/static/img/social_icons/article_page/x.svg?092716141024)]( \"Post\")\n- [![Print this page](/static/img/social_icons/article_page/print.svg?440116200824)](javascript:window.print() \"Print\")\n- [![Email this page](/static/img/social_icons/article_page/email.svg?092716141024)](mailto:?Subject=Enterprise%20software%20spend%20accelerates%20amid%20AI%20adoption%20blitz&Body=https%3A//www.ciodive.com/news/ai-spend-inflates-enterprise-software-budgets-west-monroe/760662/ \"Email\")\n- [![License this article](/static/img/social_icons/article_page/cart.svg?092716141024) purchase licensing rights](/selfservice/article-licensing/submit/?newspostUrl= \"License\")\nFiled Under:\n[IT Strategy,](/topic/IT-Strategy/) [AI & Future Tech,](/topic/ai/) [Software](/topic/software/)\n### CIO Dive news delivered to your inbox\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\nEmail:\n- Select user consent: By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

It\u2019s already here, and long-term care providers need to engage everyone around them to keep pace.\nIn fact, AI has already begun to make inroads in aging services in various applications \u2014 from the back office and staffing to resident and patient care.\nTo best manage the deluge of AI products and technology, senior care providers need to develop adequate infrastructure, invest in good data, practice sound governance and promote a flowing AI culture, added Majd Alwan, PhD, the founder and CEO of ALWAN AIVantAge. The former executive director of the Center for Aging Services Technologies at LeadingAge, Alwan delivered the keynote address at last week\u2019s McKnight\u2019s Technology Awards + Summit event.\n\u201cI sort of beg you to foster innovation \u2026 encouraging culture internally from the board executive leadership to mid-level management to frontline staff \u2014 even engaging residents \u2014 because I firmly believe that this is key to take the advantages of AI from point solutions \u2026 to a more of an ecosystem that drives the organizationwide benefits and drives it sectorwide,\u201d Alwan stressed.\nHe urges organizations to have dedicated staff members to manage the technology.\n\u201cI recommend creating an innovation team and have processes in place to identify both strategically aligned innovation opportunities which some call disruptive innovations,\u201d he said.\nTo be successful in the age of AI, the infrastructure must be ready, and the sector must invest in appropriate bandwidth and connectivity.\n\u201cIf the data is not consistent or not clean, then AI and data analytic tools will not give you the right answers,\u201d he noted. \u201cIt could be actually accelerating disasters. So we need to invest in data consistency, data cleansing and data governance in general.\u201d\nIt also is important to protect residents\u2019 and patients\u2019 health information with a robust cybersecurity framework and practice good governance.\n\u201cWe need to develop a data governance framework,\u201d he observed. \u201cReview your own data entry forms. Unify them for consistency across systems, across locations.\u201d\n## AI now in senior care\nThe dramatic growth of the senior population combined with the declining number of caregivers has created a strong business case for AI in long-term care, Alwan believes.\nBy 2035, all baby boomers will be 65 and older, he pointed out. At the same time, the ratio of potential caregivers younger than 64 to patients 80 and older will continue to tumble. The current ratio is 4 to 1. In 2050, it will be 3 to 1.\n\u201cSo this convergence represents the greatest challenge and an unprecedented opportunity to apply technology and AI in aging services,\u201d Alwan said. \u201cThis is really the perfect storm for us these days.\u201d\nCurrent AI uses in senior care include service robotics whose applications range from vacuuming, sweeping and lawnmowing to autonomous delivery of Amazon packages. Service robots, which reduce costs and allow staff to focus more on human touch, are delivering meals and clearing trays in some nursing homes and senior living dining rooms.\nIn addition, research is underway into autonomous shuttles to transport residents around campuses and to nearby malls.\nThe back office in healthcare also has been using AI, Alwan explained. Robotic process automation, or RPA, uses software agents that automate repetitive manual processes that rely on data using computers. Companies are using RPA for tasks such as billing, resubmission of denied claims, and readjustment of those claims to maximize reimbursement. This activity is beginning to migrate from large healthcare systems to more of the aging services sector, Alwan said.\n\u201cThey can significantly increase efficiency and staff productivity and, frankly, staff satisfaction because, again, staff do not like to sort of waste time on mindless repetitive tasks,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd, again, one of the advantages for claims processing is enhancing the bottom line and increasing the cash on hand and reducing the wait time for collecting on accounts receivable.\u201d\n## Deeper uses\nPredictive analytics are also in play, with AI agents able to continuously analyze biometric data or electronic health record data as well as data from motion sensors to predict health episodes before they occur, or before they exacerbate and share that information with clinicians for early interventions.\nOther AI applications include personalized care plans, which allow adaptive systems to change care strategies based on an individual\u2019s or the patient\u2019s individual preferences. AI also improves social engagement and connectedness through physical robots, or avatars that incorporate information about the resident\u2019s history and preferences.\nMeanwhile, smart environments, which use autonomous systems that automate daily tasks, detect and prevent incidents, optimize living conditions, and enable aging in place are part of home care and senior housing.\nTo help with staffing, AI platforms are using machine learning and natural language processing to quickly analyze r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to identify qualified candidates, reducing manual efforts for human resources and speeding the screening process. There are also chatbot engagement tools that engage the candidates early on to automate initial communications with the candidate.\nMeanwhile, job-matching algorithms match caregivers to roles based not only on the skills and preferences and availability but also the hiring managers\u2019 history and traits. Such tools have improved placement accuracy, reduced mismatches and turnover and increased retention. Self-scheduling and staffing tools can optimize staff scheduling, minimizing the need to use agency staff.\n## Too many pilots?\nHaving directed influential research at LeadingAge, Alwan said he has seen many technology pilots fail because of improper planning, not solving for the right problem or lack of leadership commitment. There often is a failure to measure, document and share objective outcomes, especially ROI, which is complex, he added.\n\u201cIt\u2019s complex because we have multiple payers in the aging services world and we have sort of a misalignment of incentives between the payer and the provider,\u201d he said.\nVendors, he added, also can overpromise what their technology can do.\n\u201cWhen faced with realities, they find themselves, or providers find them, to be underdelivering,\u201d he said.\n## History of AI\nAI is formally known as the field of computer science that tries to replicate human intelligence. It began in 1950 when British mathematician Alan Turing wrote a paper that introduced the concept of machine intelligence, Alwan explained. Turing created what is known as the Turing Test \u2014 based on whether a machine can convince a human interacting with it that they are interacting with a human.\nAI became a household name in 2022 when OpenAI launched ChatGPT, bringing large language models to public use.\nThe annual McKnight\u2019s Tech Awards + Forum took place Sept. 16-17, culminating with the 15th annual awards presentation.\nAll seven webinars and other segments remain available for viewing on demand.

It\u2019s already here, Majd Alwan, PhD, said during the opening keynote address of the *McKnight\u2019s* Technology Awards + Summit last week. AI is beginning to make inroads in aging services in various applications \u2014 from the back office and staffing to resident and patient care, he said.\nTo manage the deluge of AI products and technology, senior living and care providers need to develop an infrastructure, invest in good data, practice sound governance and promote an AI culture, he added.\n\u201cI sort of beg you to foster innovation \u2026 encouraging culture internally, from the board executive leadership to mid-level management to frontline staff \u2014 even engaging residents \u2014 because I firmly believe that this is key to take the advantages of AI from point solutions \u2026 to more of an ecosystem that drives the organizationwide benefits and drives it sectorwide,\u201d said Alwan, the founder and CEO of ALWAN AIVantAge and former executive director of the LeadingAge Center for Aging Services Technologies. He made the remarks Tuesday, the first day of the two-day event.\nAlwan urged organizations to have dedicated staff members to manage the technology.\n\u201cI recommend creating an innovation team and have processes in place to identify both strategically aligned innovation opportunities which some call disruptive innovations,\u201d he said.\nTo be successful in the age of AI, the infrastructure must be ready, and the sector must invest in appropriate bandwidth and connectivity, Alwan said.\n\u201cIf the data is not consistent or not clean, then AI and data analytic tools will not give you the right answers,\u201d he noted. \u201cIt could be actually accelerating disasters.

Unify them for consistency across systems, across locations.\u201d\n## AI uses in senior living and care\nThe dramatic growth of the older adult population, combined with the declining number of caregivers, has created a strong business case for AI in long-term care, he said. By 2035, all baby boomers will be 65 and older, he pointed out. At the same time, he said, there is a decreasing ratio of potential caregivers younger than 64 to people aged 80 or more years. The current ratio is 4 to 1. In 2050, it will be 3 to 1.\n\u201cSo this convergence represents the greatest challenge and an unprecedented opportunity to apply technology and AI in aging services,\u201d Alwan said. \u201cThis is really the perfect storm for us these days.\u201d\nCurrent AI uses in senior care, he said, include service robotics for which applications range from vacuuming, sweeping and lawnmowing to the autonomous delivery of Amazon packages. Service robots, which reduce costs and allow staff members to focus more on human touch, are delivering meals and clearing trays in some nursing home and senior living community dining rooms, he added.\nIn addition, research is underway into autonomous shuttles to transport residents around campuses and to nearby malls, Alwan noted.\nThe back office in healthcare also has been using AI, he explained. Robotic process automation, or RPA, uses software agents that automate repetitive manual processes that rely on data using computers. Companies are using RPA for tasks such as billing, resubmission of denied claims, and readjustment of those claims to maximize reimbursement. This activity is beginning to migrate from large healthcare systems to more of the aging services sector, Alwan said.\n\u201cThey can significantly increase efficiency and staff productivity and, frankly, staff satisfaction because, again, staff do not like to sort of waste time on mindless repetitive tasks,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd, again, one of the advantages for claims processing is enhancing the bottom line and increasing the cash on hand and reducing the wait time for collecting on accounts receivable.\u201d\nPredictive analytics are also in play, Alwan said, with AI agents able to continuously analyze biometric data or electronic health records data as well as data from motion sensors to predict health episodes before they occur, or before they exacerbate and share that information with clinicians for early interventions.\nAmong other AI applications he delineated are personalized care plans, which allow adaptive systems to change care strategies based on an individual\u2019s individual preferences. AI also improves social engagement and connectedness through physical robots, or avatars that incorporate information about the resident\u2019s history and preferences, Alwan said. Meanwhile, he added, smart environments, which use autonomous systems that automate daily tasks, detect and prevent incidents, optimize living conditions, and enable aging in place are part of home care and senior housing.\nTo help with staffing, AI platforms are using machine learning and natural language processing to quickly analyze r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to identify qualified candidates, reducing manual efforts for human resources and speeding the screening process, Alwan said. Also, he added, chatbot engagement tools engage candidates early on, to automate initial communications with them.\nMeanwhile, job-matching algorithms match caregivers to roles based not only on the skills and preferences and availability but also the hiring managers\u2019 history and traits, he noted. Such tools have improved placement accuracy, reduced mismatches and turnover and increased retention, he added, and self-scheduling and staffing tools can optimize staff scheduling, minimizing the need to use agency staff.\n## Too many pilots?\nAlwan, who directed influential research at LeadingAge, said he has seen many technology pilot projects fail because of improper planning, not solving for the right problem and lack of leadership commitment, among other reasons.

It began in 1950 when British mathematician Alan Turing wrote a paper that introduced the concept of machine intelligence, Alwan explained. Turing created what is known as the Turing Test \u2014 based on whether a machine can convince a human interacting with it that he or she is interacting with a human.\nAI became a household name in 2022 when OpenAI launched ChatGPT, bringing large language models to public use.\nThe annual *McKnight\u2019s* Tech Awards + Forum took place Tuesday and Wednesday.

At that time, we were not quite one year into the launch of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, a Gen AI chatbot able to generate human-like responses to written prompts, which was seemingly an entertaining distraction. We concluded that *\u201cP**atience is warranted as is being selective in investing, but if Gen AI lives up to the expectations and enthusiasm, it will generate tremendous value and wealth for companies and investors for years to come.\u201d* Fast forward two years, and we repeat that statement.\nWe say this despite developments including the imposition of tariffs and export restrictions on semiconductor manufacturers and the recognition of the China-based DeepSeek large language model (LLM), which spurred concerns about Gen AI economics for U.S. companies. The Gen AI train keeps rolling, and these events have done little to quell our excitement around its potential.\nChatGPT, a large language model or LLM, accelerated a lightning-paced race and spending spree to create an ever more powerful LLM. ChatGPT has over 800 million users, according to JP Morgan, and is the second fastest growing digital app in history, while OpenAI, a private company, is worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Other models in the race include Google\u2019s Gemini, Meta\u2019s Llama, and DeepSeek, which made a big splash with the January 2025 release of its updated DeepSeek-R1\u00a0LLM that made U.S.-based tech companies take notice of China\u2019s Gen AI progress.\nGen AI performance is accelerating, and ChatGPT has advanced from merely an entertaining distraction. The capability of Gen AI, as measured by the length of tasks Gen AI can complete, has been doubling roughly every seven\u00a0months, according to Morgan Stanley, and Gen AI\u2019s use cases are far-reaching and already impacting many industries from healthcare (drug development) to manufacturing (automating processes with robotics).\nTo date, the biggest Gen AI use cases have been in the industry that spurred its creation \u2014 technology \u2014 assisting developers by writing, translating, and verifying code, effectively streamlining the software development process. Large software companies such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Salesforce (CRM) have spoken about the internal efficiencies garnered by using Gen AI tools. CRM CEO Marc Benioff has said that artificial intelligence is already handling up to half of the company's tasks. *\u201c**We're looking at productivity levels of 30% to 50% this year in key functions like engineering, coding and support*.*\u201d* MSFT reported that 30% of its code is Gen AI-written. Anthropic\u2019s CEO expects 90% of code to be Gen AI-written in three\u00a0to six\u00a0months.\nLarge technology companies/hyperscalers and Gen AI startups are in heavy Gen AI investment mode. According to JP Morgan, over $315 billion has been invested in Gen AI startups since 2023, with 18% of that alone going to OpenAI. The Magnificent 7 (Mag 7) are on course to spend $700-800 billion in capex and R&D in 2025, up 30-40% from 2024, with this spending centered on Gen AI infrastructure, such as data centers. Morgan Stanley estimates that nearly $3 trillion will be spent on data centers globally through 2028, with over 80% for Gen AI-specific uses.\n![](\n![](\nIn fact, tech sector capital spending is so large, according to JP Morgan, that it has been contributing a whopping 35%-45% of overall U.S. GDP growth over the last three quarters.\n![](\nIt is expected that these massive Gen AI investments will eventually generate value and a return on investment (ROI) primarily via labor productivity but also by driving revenue growth through better innovation and data insights. In a February 2025 report, Morgan Stanley estimated that Gen AI will generate approximately ~$150 billion in annual pre-tax income for the S&P by 2028 and $1.5-2 trillion in market value creation, or a 3% increase in the S&P, and up to ~$920 billion in pre-tax profits and $13\u201316 trillion in potential market value creation over the long-term, or a 25% increase. Further, they pointed out that Gen AI investments have had a negative ROI to date but should yield a positive ROI in 2025. Although as infrastructure investments have continued to climb to levels greater than the estimated $300 billion at the time, it\u2019s not clear whether this prediction will materialize in 2025.\nGen AI returns will come as the technology is adopted across businesses, and although adoption is accelerating, it is still arguably in early stages. According to a Morgan Stanley August 2025 report, approximately 56% of companies worldwide were using Gen AI in 2025, up from 33**% in 2024.** The technology sector is leading the way in Gen AI use cases, but most industries are experiencing double-digit usage increases. Yet, according to the report, only 259 companies, comprising $8.5 trillion of market capitalization or 15-16% of the S&P 500, viewed Gen AI as a material factor. However, another 412 companies, $8.7 trillion in market cap or 15-16% of the S&P, see Gen AI use on the rise.\nThe New York Federal Reserve found that fewer, or 25\u201340%, of firms are using Gen AI, in an August 2025 survey of service and manufacturing businesses in the New York/New Jersey region, although this is up from 15-25% in 2024. Further, Gen AI is being used in a limited fashion, such as in hiring and training. As a result, they found only a modest impact on jobs, as service firms surprisingly reported a reduction in AI-related layoffs in the last year, and manufacturing firms reported no layoffs due to the technology. There is evidence, though, that hiring is being scaled back, as about 25% and 10% of service and manufacturing firms, respectively, said they plan to hire fewer workers in the future due to Gen AI. Morgan Stanley predicts that eventually 90% of occupations will be affected by Gen AI, either through automation (AI replacing tasks) or augmentation (AI assisting workers).\n![](\nAlthough Gen AI adoption is a key gating factor to the level and pace of the payback on Gen AI investments, potential bottlenecks, particularly as it relates to data center development, may play a role too. Gen AI models demand a tremendous amount of power, and power availability is expected to worsen as we transition from the training-heavy stage of LLM development to the more energy-intensive inference stage of model use, the phase where a trained AI model uses its learned knowledge to generate new outputs or predictions in real-time, based on user prompts.\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, U.S. data center power demand is forecasted to reach upwards of ~100 gigawatts (GW) by 2028, more than doubling from approximately 40 GW in 2024. This creates an approximately 45 GW shortfall in U.S. grid capacity. As a frame of reference, the power usage for the greater Philadelphia metropolitan area is approximately 3 GWs on average. Further, many U.S. grids currently face massive interconnection backlogs with wait times stretching five to ten years versus two to three years historically.\n![](\nOther data center development bottlenecks include supply constraints for GPUs (graphic processing units or chips), turbines, cooling and electrical gear, and labor and permitting.\nThe technology revolution of Gen AI is upon us, but the pace and progress of its impact on economics and society will not be linear. Patience is warranted.\n## **Investment Implications**\nGiven that we are in the development/investment phase for Gen AI, the returns on these investments have been concentrated in a select group of companies that are key to the infrastructure build \u2014 semiconductors, cloud operators, technology hardware, and to some extent, the power sector. Generally, the benefit to companies in other sectors has not been as material or is yet to come.\nThe benefit to semiconductor manufacturers is clear in Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) results over the last two years, with revenues five times higher, earnings per share (EPS) seven times\u00a0greater, and the stock up nearly +300%. But other beneficiaries include Microsoft (MSFT) (cloud infrastructure), Broadcom (AVGO) (semiconductors), Arista Networks (ANET) (networking, switching, and routing equipment), Dell Technologies (DELL) (servers), and Vertiv (VRT) (cooling equipment).\nAlthough Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) Web Services (AWS) division (cloud infrastructure) growth has not kept up with MSFT, given capacity constraints and MSFT\u2019s advantageous relationship with OpenAI, we continue to believe that AWS\u2019s growth will accelerate alongside other cloud providers.\nWe\u2019ve also seen a positive impact on the results of independent power providers like Constellation Energy (CEG) that, given the lack of regulation, are the first in line to take advantage of the soaring power needs. Regulated utilities with clean power, such as natural gas and nuclear, should also benefit, and the signing of deals with big tech companies, like Meta, in the case of Entergy (ETR), is evidence of future growth to come.\nCompanies that provide equipment used in power production, like Eaton (ETN), should also benefit.\nThe impact on data center operators, such as Equinix (EQIX), has been more mixed as the higher capex required to meet surging demand has weighed on the stock, yet we still believe EQIX and Digital Realty (DLR) will benefit in the future from tremendous spending on data centers.\nGen AI should drive consumer monetization, such as in search\u00a0AI-driven ads, and personal shopping assistants, and new categories, such as autonomous vehicles and wearables. We have seen consumer monetization in the results of Meta (META) and Google (GOOGL).\nAs we get further beyond the infrastructure investment phase of Gen AI and into the deployment of Gen AI products, enterprise software and SAS (software as a service) companies that embed Gen AI capabilities into their products should benefit \u2014 companies like Service Now (NOW) and Salesforce (CRM). Further, security software companies like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and CrowdStrike (CRWD) should benefit as Gen AI most likely creates more security threats. Although software monetization of Gen AI has yet to broadly materialize, we still believe it will as adoption grows.\nSome caution and patience in investing, though, is warranted as the market could get ahead of the realization of Gen AI\u2019s potential. Ironically, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, which owns ChatGPT, said in an August 2025 interview: *\u201cAre we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes. Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.\u201d*\nWe don\u2019t waver from our statement about Gen AI of two years ago, but are braced for volatility and intend to keep our sights focused on the long-term potential of this supercharged new technology.\nYours in trust,\n[Kristin](/wealth-management/kristin-ketner-pak)\u00a0and [Paul](/wealth-management/paul-jablansky)\n### Bibliography\nMorgan Stanley (2025, February 25).

While its potential benefits are undeniable, AI is also creating new and unprecedented risks, particularly in the field of warfare. This makes it a truly double-edged sword.\nOn the one hand, it can serve humanity by advancing education, revolutionizing healthcare and improving quality of life across the globe. On the other, it can intensify conflicts, reshape military operations and raise serious ethical concerns when used as a weapon of war. The balance between these two realities will define how this technology shapes the future of our world.\nIn the realm of education, AI offers hope and opportunity. Education has long been a sector plagued by inequalities, with students in wealthier societies often having access to better schools, teachers and learning materials, while those in less-developed regions are left behind. AI has the potential to narrow this gap. By using intelligent tutoring systems, machine learning algorithms and adaptive platforms, AI can personalize the learning experience for every student.\nThe healthcare sector is another area where AI is already demonstrating revolutionary potential. Traditionally, healthcare systems have struggled with issues of accessibility, cost and human error. AI is beginning to address all of these. One of the most significant contributions comes in the field of diagnostics. Machine learning algorithms trained on millions of medical images are now capable of detecting conditions such as cancer, strokes or neurological disorders at an earlier stage and with levels of accuracy that rival or even surpass human doctors.\n**The balance between these two realities will define how this technology shapes the future of our world**\nDr. Majid Rafizadeh\nYet, as beneficial as AI can be in education and healthcare, the same technology is increasingly being used in warfare. AI is transforming modern battlefields, not only in theory but in practice. In recent years, militaries around the world have integrated AI into every aspect of their operations, from surveillance and intelligence gathering to targeting and logistics.\nAutonomous drones, powered by AI algorithms, can identify, track and even strike targets with minimal human input. These drones can navigate complex environments, evade enemy defenses and adjust their actions in real time. AI also drives predictive analytics that can anticipate enemy movements, analyze satellite imagery and process vast amounts of intercepted communications at speeds that human analysts cannot match. All of this translates into faster decision-making, greater accuracy and the potential for fewer mistakes \u2014 at least in theory.\nThe Russia-Ukraine war has already provided concrete examples of AI in action. Ukraine has\u00a0deployed\u00a0AI-powered drones that can autonomously identify and attack enemy positions. These drones, trained with advanced algorithms, can fly low, evade radar and strike military targets with precision. Russia, in turn, has invested heavily in counterdrone systems and AI-assisted electronic warfare tools. Reports suggest that Russian systems have used AI to detect, track and neutralize incoming drones, highlighting how AI has become a central element in the back-and-forth technological arms race of the conflict. These examples show that AI is no longer a theoretical concept in warfare \u2014 it is actively shaping outcomes on the battlefield.\nWhile some officials argue that such systems improve accuracy and reduce civilian casualties by focusing only on legitimate targets, the use of AI in war inevitably raises the question of accountability. If an AI system misidentifies a target and innocent lives are lost, who bears responsibility \u2014 the programmers, the military operators or the technology itself?\nThis brings us to the ethical debate surrounding AI in warfare, which has become one of the most heated issues in international security today. On one side, proponents argue that AI can make warfare more humane by reducing unnecessary suffering. They suggest that AI\u2019s ability to process vast amounts of data quickly can minimize mistakes, avoid accidental bombings of civilian areas and even take soldiers out of harm\u2019s way by delegating dangerous tasks to machines. For these advocates, AI could be a way to fight wars with fewer casualties and with greater precision.\n**The same algorithms that diagnose diseases or teach children can also guide missiles or control drones**\nDr. Majid Rafizadeh\nOn the other side, critics warn of the dangers of delegating life-and-death decisions to machines. They argue that AI systems, no matter how advanced, lack the moral reasoning and ethical judgment required in combat situations. An AI might be able to calculate probabilities and identify heat signatures, but it cannot understand human context or moral nuance.\nMoreover, reliance on AI could make starting wars easier, as governments may feel emboldened if their own soldiers are less likely to die in combat. This could lower the threshold for military engagement and lead to more conflicts, not fewer. Critics also highlight the dangers of malfunction, hacking or intentional misuse, which could result in catastrophic outcomes.\nIn the end, AI is undeniably a double-edged sword. It holds the power to transform societies for the better through innovations in education and healthcare that can uplift millions of lives. At the same time, it has the potential to magnify destruction when employed in warfare. The same algorithms that diagnose diseases or teach children can also guide missiles or control drones.\nThis dual nature of AI forces humanity to confront difficult questions about responsibility, morality and the future of warfare. As AI continues to advance, global leaders, policymakers and citizens must grapple with its implications. The choices made today will determine whether AI becomes a tool for human flourishing or a weapon that escalates global conflict.\n### [Opinion](/opinion)\n### [Qatar crisis reshapes Gulf security architecture](/node/2616197)\n!Author\n### [High stakes at UN\u2019s annual Climate Week](/node/2616182)\n!Author\n### [Time to delink climate action from Western election swings](/node/2616179)\n!Author\n### [The first AI government minister](/node/2616176)\n!Author\n### [Israel under Netanyahu has no red lines](/node/2616105)\n!Author\n## Latest updates\n### [\u2018Fast and furious\u2019: H-1B workers abroad race to US as Trump order sparks dismay, confusion](/node/2616210/world)\n!\u2018Fast and furious\u2019: H-1B workers abroad race to US as Trump order sparks dismay, confusion\n### [Torres double helps Barcelona cruise to 3-0 victory over Getafe](/node/2616208/sport)\n!Torres double helps Barcelona cruise to 3-0 victory over Getafe\n### [Saudi Arabia welcomes recognition of Palestine by four Western states](/node/2616207/saudi-arabia)\n!Saudi Arabia welcomes recognition of Palestine by four Western states\n### [French politicians bicker over Palestinian flags outside town halls](/node/2616205/world)\n!French politicians bicker over Palestinian flags outside town halls\n### [Arsenal late show denies Man City, Villa still winless](/node/2616203/sport)\n!Arsenal late show denies Man City, Villa still winless\n### [Columnist](#)\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n![Logo](/sites/all/themes/narabnews/assets/img/45-logo-mobile-new.png?21ssa12ss \"Arabnews\")\n##### EMAIL ALERTS\n###### Stay on top of the issues that matter to you the most.\n## Search form\n###### Print Edition.![](//mena-gmtdmp.mookie1.com/t/v2/learn?tagid=V2_605775&src.rand=[timestamp])\n## Search form\n![Logo](/sites/all/themes/narabnews/assets/img/45-logo-mobile-new.png?21sa12 \"Arabnews\")\n![Logo](/sites/all/themes/narabnews/assets/img/45-logo-mobile-new.png?21sssa12 \"Arabnews\")\n## Search form\n## You are here\n# Saudi Arabia\u2019s bet on deep tech to shape future of energy\n!Author\n!Author\n## Saudi Arabia\u2019s bet on deep tech to shape future of energy\n!Author\n!Saudi Arabia\u2019s bet on deep tech to shape future of energy\nSaudi Arabia stands at a pivotal juncture, embarking on a profound economic and technological transformation aimed toward building a knowledge-based economy.\nCentral to this ambitious vision is the development of the deep-tech sector, representing the intersection of advanced scientific research and emerging technologies capable of reshaping entire industries.\nThe Kingdom\u2019s ecosystem is now recognized among the leading startup destinations in the Middle East, commanding significant venture funding and deal volume.\nWhat distinguishes Saudi Arabia\u2019s deep tech ecosystem is its integration with national energy ambitions \u2014 where startups are not just building apps or hardware, but tackling frontier challenges in grid resilience, hydrogen innovation, and sustainable infrastructure.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s planned increase in research and development spending \u2014 targeting approximately 2.5 percent of gross domestic product by 2040 \u2014 reflects a robust commitment to innovation with expenditures already rising by 17.4 percent to around $6 billion in 2023, alongside a notable 22.1 percent increase in the number of active researches, representing a tenfold increase from $2.4 billion in 2019 to nearly $28 billion by 2040.\nDespite such promising developments, considerable hurdles remain. Deep tech ventures inherently involve substantial initial capital, extended development timelines, and complex market-entry barriers.\nLocal venture capital, while growing, remains relatively limited compared to established ecosystems such as Silicon Valley or Shenzhen. The scale of private sector engagement, crucial for mature innovation ecosystems, has not yet matched the magnitude of governmental investments.\nFurthermore, Saudi Arabia\u2019s talent pool, although improving through expanded STEM initiatives and eased visa regulations for foreign experts, still faces deficits in specialized, advanced skills essential for scaling deep tech ventures, particularly in areas such as quantum computing, advanced materials, and sophisticated semiconductor industries.\nGlobally, Saudi Arabia can glean insights from deep tech ecosystems in the US, China, and Europe. Silicon Valley thrives through robust private investment and close collaboration with leading research universities, whereas Shenzhen leveraged state-driven economic zones to build deep technological expertise rapidly.\nEurope, especially Germany and France, emphasizes public-private partnerships, industrial research hubs, and strategic R&D tax incentives. Saudi Arabia is uniquely positioned to blend these distinct strategies: it already employs special economic zones like NEOM and proactive regulatory reforms and aims to be a global talent hub.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s Vision 2030 framework acts as an enabling platform, aligning cross-sector investments with national innovation objectives while embedding sustainability and resilience at its core. Accordingly, these efforts significantly contribute to the Kingdom\u2019s GDP and employment opportunities, offering high-quality jobs in advanced sectors and reducing reliance on traditional industries.\nThis supports the Kingdom\u2019s national pledge of achieving net-zero emissions by 2060, alongside its ambitious goal of generating half its electricity from renewable sources by 2030, which fundamentally hinges on breakthrough deep tech solutions in renewables integration, grid-scale storage, carbon capture, and utilization technologies.\nAs Kenneth Gillingham, professor of Economics at Yale University explains: \u201cReducing domestic consumption of fossil fuels allows energy-exporting countries to redirect valuable resources toward export markets, thereby supporting national economic resilience. For Saudi Arabia, this shift also aligns with the broader imperative of global decarbonization. Deep tech, particularly in areas like grid optimization, energy storage, and emissions management, may prove to be a critical enabler in achieving and sustaining these dual objectives.\u201d\nThis insight underscores the dual opportunity for Saudi Arabia: securing economic gains through increased exports while simultaneously accelerating its transition to a low-emissions future through strategic advancement of its deep tech sector.\nTo continue strengthening its position in the global deep tech landscape, Saudi Arabia must adopt several key strategies.\nFirst, incentivizing substantial private venture capital participation is critical. Co-investment schemes and targeted tax incentives could spur greater private engagement, reducing the Kingdom\u2019s reliance on state financing alone.\nSecond, talent cultivation should be significantly deepened through specialized university-industry collaborations, expanded international scholarships in frontier tech domains, and proactive efforts to attract and retain international expertise.\nThird, regulatory sandboxes should be more aggressively deployed to expedite testing and commercialization of energy breakthroughs, particularly in renewable integration, hydrogen technologies, and carbon management.\nFourth, the Kingdom should elevate global partnerships, fostering intensive collaborations with renowned global research institutions in the US, Europe, and China to drive innovation and integrate Saudi deep tech ventures into international supply chains.\nFifth, enhancing access to advanced testing facilities, prototyping labs, and deep-tech incubators can shorten development cycles and strategically improve investor confidence.\nDeep tech plays a pivotal role in reducing unemployment by fostering high-value industries that require specialized skills. As these sectors expand, they absorb a growing pool of highly educated Saudi graduates, addressing structural employment challenges highlighted in recent studies on the Kingdom\u2019s transition to a knowledge-based economy.\nIf nurtured with foresight and coordination, Saudi Arabia\u2019s deep tech revolution could become a cornerstone of its economic competitiveness and environmental leadership and sustainable development in the decades to come.\n*\u2022 Hamad S.

Not quite, but close enough to cause concern\nWhilst everyone\u2019s talking about artificial intelligence replacing jobs, there\u2019s a far more fascinating revolution brewing: the potential for dismantling the entire monetary system as we know it. Before you dismiss this as another crypto-bro fever dream, hear me out.\nImagine a world where sophisticated AI agents are constantly matching trades across vast networks. Not just neolithic barters of the \u201ctwo sheep for a cow\u201d variety, but enormously complex, multi-party deals happening in milliseconds. Rather like a global game of financial Tetris, but with commodities, services, and obligations all slotting together perfectly.\nIn this world, traditional currencies might become rather quaint, like bringing an abacus to a quantum computing conference.\nIt might resurrect some remarkably ancient ideas about value and trust. Remember the hawala networks? Those centuries-old trust-based money transfer systems beloved by both legitimate traders and shadowy operators? Well, they might just offer a preview of our future \u2014 albeit with AI playing the role of the digital hawaladar.\nConsider the concrete examples: A Chinese company recently exported $2 million in automotive parts to Iran in exchange for pistachios. Malaysia and China executed a palm oil trade worth $150 million, exchanging it for construction services and natural resources. These aren\u2019t improvisations \u2014 they\u2019re systematic developments in alternative economic architecture.\nThe transformation runs deeper than mere sanctions evasion. We\u2019re witnessing the convergence of three powerful forces: artificial intelligence, commodity-based trade, and alternative payment networks. Imagine AI agents constantly matching trades across vast networks \u2014 not simple \u201ctwo sheep for a cow\u201d barters, but enormously complex, multi-party deals happening in milliseconds. It\u2019s like a global game of financial Tetris, with commodities, services, and obligations all slotting together perfectly.\nThis evolution naturally favours different players than the traditional financial system. Russia\u2019s gold exports to China surged after Western sanctions in 2022. The UAE emerged as a key hub for international gold trade before Chinese markets took prominence. Russian companies have begun selling gold in Hong Kong and depositing proceeds in local banks to pay Chinese suppliers \u2014 a modern adaptation of ancient trading practices.\nWhat\u2019s particularly fascinating is how this might reshape global power. Traditional financial centers like London might find themselves playing second fiddle to places that control physical resources or sit at the crossroads of trade networks. Dubai, with its combination of commodity flows, trading networks, and embrace of future tech, could become more strategically important than Frankfurt.\nThe real winners? Rather than banks, we might see the rise of hybrid organizations that can juggle physical commodities, digital assets, and trust networks \u2014 think Glencore meets Google meets Goldman Sachs. Trading houses might evolve from shifting physical commodities to orchestrating complex value networks, with AI agents as their digital workforce.\nThis transformation raises fundamental questions about monetary policy and financial regulation. When Pakistan can trade directly with Russia for essential materials, when Iran can exchange drones for gold, and when China can process Russian payments through regional banks, traditional financial controls become increasingly less relevant. Countries rich in physical resources but traditionally peripheral to global finance \u2014 think Russia, Brazil, or Indonesia \u2014 might find themselves with unprecedented leverage in this new world.\nMost provocatively, this might not lead to a single, efficient global market but rather to a messy, organic network of parallel systems, some official, some decidedly not. Rather, the internet evolved from a clean, academic network into the unruly and chaotic system we have today.\nThe movement toward parallel economic systems appears not just possible but increasingly inevitable. The real question isn\u2019t whether this transformation is coming \u2014 it\u2019s already here. The question is who will be clever enough to position themselves for it. After all, in a world where AI agents are constantly optimizing trades across multiple systems, the power might not lie in controlling any single currency or market but in managing the boundaries between them.\nNow, there\u2019s a thought to keep central bankers up at night.\n*\u2022\u00a0Adrian Monck writes a weekly newsletter, Seven Things.

Families are torn apart, healthcare systems lie in ruins, and routine medical care has become a distant memory. The conflict has turned everyday survival into a monumental challenge; civilians face violence, displacement, hunger, and illness without access to even basic health services. This unfolding tragedy not only undermines the past sense of normalcy but also erodes hope. The inability to care for the sick and vulnerable assaults the core of human dignity. Hospitals have been attacked, clinics looted and occupied, and health workers have either fled, been threatened, or paid with their lives. These are not just physical injuries \u2014 this is a psychological blow to a nation\u2019s spirit. Over the past two years, the war between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces has turned critical portions of the health system into ghost towns. Almost 38 percent of health facilities have been rendered nonfunctional, and just 14 percent of hospitals still operate at full capacity, according to assessments by the World Health Organization\u2019s HeRAMS monitoring program. Khartoum \u2014 once the heartbeat of Sudan\u2019s health services, providing close to 70 percent of national care \u2014 has been particularly devastated. In many areas, medical facilities lie in ruins, with equipment destroyed or looted, and essential supply chains severed. Physical buildings are one thing, but the collapse of system-wide structure is far worse. Laboratories have shut down, pharmacies stand empty, vaccine cold chains have failed, and even simple medicines like antibiotics or insulin are scarce. Without trained staff, even basic functions like triage or sanitation are impossible. Women face childbirth without skilled attendants; patients with chronic conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, or kidney disease, are ignored. The interruption of services for dialysis, antenatal care, and trauma threatens countless lives every day. On top of this devastation, Sudan is in the grip of multiple, overlapping epidemics. Cholera has spread to almost all of the country\u2019s states, overwhelming treatment centers, particularly in Darfur, where the toll has been especially heavy. Measles, once controlled through routine immunization, is surging, with almost 10,000 cases treated by Medecins Sans Frontieres clinics between June 2024 and May 2025. Hundreds of thousands of children have not received any vaccines, leaving them vulnerable to preventable diseases. Malaria cases are also surging, though true numbers are likely underreported due to collapsed surveillance systems. Alarmingly, 3.4 million children under five are at heightened risk from diseases such as pneumonia, diarrhea, malaria, and measles. This confluence of disease and conflict is happening alongside a humanitarian catastrophe. More than two-thirds of the population now needs aid, with millions facing famine-level hunger. Food shortages, coupled with skyrocketing prices and population displacement, have left countless Sudanese on the brink of starvation. Even in areas not directly under fire, malnutrition is causing immune systems to fail, making people more vulnerable to illness, and more likely to die of what would, in normal times, be treatable or preventable ailments. If current trends continue unchecked, Sudan faces a bleak future. Without functional health services, disease outbreaks will repeat year after year, claiming lives in waves. Preventable deaths will climb as complications from childbirth, infections, and chronic illnesses go untreated. Starvation will weaken the population further, creating a cycle of suffering that deepens with each passing season. Deaths will not just be tallied in tolls from violence but will come quietly, in homes, camps, and the streets. Moreover, Sudan\u2019s collapse is already spilling beyond its borders. The country hosts one of the largest internal displacement crises globally, and refugees fleeing by the hundreds of thousands are crossing into Chad, South Sudan, Egypt, and beyond. Overcrowded, under-resourced camps have become breeding grounds for disease, with cholera and measles now spreading across borders. Neighboring countries, many also with fragile systems, risk being overwhelmed. Healthcare resources are being diverted, budgets strained, and regional stability is compromised. Without immediate action, the ripple effects may reach even further, testing the resilience of health systems across the Horn of Africa, Sahel, and along vital Red Sea trade corridors. The need for international intervention is both urgent and obvious. A powerful, coordinated response could make the difference between controlled recovery and irreversible collapse. First and foremost, a ceasefire that ensures safe humanitarian corridors is essential. Without peace, or at least reliable access, aid cannot reach those in need. Humanitarian pauses would allow for the repair of water systems, delivery of vaccines, restoration of cold chains, and evacuation of the critically ill. Protection of healthcare must be enforced. More than 600 verified attacks on health facilities since 2023 have destroyed the very structures meant to save lives. Healthcare deserves the highest levels of international legal protection, and perpetrators must be held accountable for destroying hospitals and killing health workers.\n**Every day of inaction means more children dying.**\n*Dr. Majid Rafizadeh*\nDonations to support lifesaving health and nutrition interventions are urgently needed. WHO, UNICEF, MSF, International Rescue Committee, and other front-line responders are operating with huge funding gaps. Without emergency financing, services such as oral cholera vaccination, measles campaigns, mobile clinics, trauma kits, and nutrition support will fail. Fuel for generators and cold chains, oxygen for acute care, food for malnourished children, and medicines for chronic patients must be prioritized immediately. High-impact campaigns such as mass vaccinations, and water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions can break disease cycles. Mobile outreach services should follow displaced populations and deliver care even in remote areas. More oral cholera and measles vaccines, hygiene kits, and water chlorination are proven, cost-effective tools. For vulnerable border areas, pre-positioned supplies and technical support can contain the spread of diseases beyond Sudan. Front-line NGOs deserve both support and freedom to operate. They provide surgical services, treat cholera and malnutrition, and keep fragile systems alive in impossible conditions. Unrestricted, flexible funding and eased logistics are lifelines that save lives. In sum, Sudan\u2019s health emergency is one of the most urgent global crises of our time. The world cannot afford complacency or wait for a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d that may never come. Every day of inaction means more children dying from preventable illnesses, more mothers perishing in childbirth, and more families stripped of their dignity. A concerted, compassionate response anchored in humanitarian principles and fueled by international solidarity still has power to prevent further catastrophe. But time is running out \u2014 and with it, the chance to preserve the lives and futures of millions.\n### [Opinion](/opinion)\n##### [Turkiye\u2019s multivector foreign policy both a choice and a necessity](/node/2614243)\n!Author\n##### [Israel PM searches in vain for a country to take Gaza\u2019s displaced](/node/2614242)\n!Author\n##### [Yunus puts Rohingya back on the global agenda](/node/2614239)\n!Author\n##### [Data is the new oil \u2014 but who is refining it for Vision 2030?](/node/2614185)\n!Author\n##### [Israel risks isolation due to its Middle East policies](/node/2614177)\n!Author\n### Latest updates\n###### [\u2018No curse\u2019 on England, insists Tuchel despite near misses](/node/2614248/sport)\n!\u2018No curse\u2019 on England, insists Tuchel despite near misses\n###### [RSF commits \u2018myriad crimes against humanity\u2019 in Sudan: UN probe](/node/2614247/middle-east)\n!RSF commits \u2018myriad crimes against humanity\u2019 in Sudan: UN probe\n###### [Japan, Australia to deepen defense ties](/node/2614244/world)\n!Japan, Australia to deepen defense ties\n###### [Israel army says will target Gaza City high rises \u2018in coming days\u2019](/node/2614241/middle-east)\n!Israel army says will target Gaza City high rises \u2018in coming days\u2019\n###### [UK deputy prime minister resigns after inquiry into her tax payment on home purchase](/node/2614240/world)\n!UK deputy prime minister resigns after inquiry into her tax payment on home purchase\n### [Columnist](#)\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n!Author\n![Logo](/sites/all/themes/narabnews/assets/img/45-logo-mobile-new.png?21ssa12ss \"Arabnews\")\n##### EMAIL ALERTS\n###### Stay on top of the issues that matter to you the most.\n## Search form\n###### Print Edition"

The goal is to enhance personalization, efficiency, and service delivery for its 1.5 million customers nationwide.\nFollowing the successful build of its real-time enterprise data and analytical system using Google Cloud's BigQuery data warehouse platform, Insignia Financial is deepening its collaboration through a multifaceted roadmap that includes:\n- **Bespoke customer experiences** tailored to each member's life stage and financial needs, powered by Insignia's newly completed Data and Insights platform built on BigQuery. This is supported by a fleet of enterprise-ready AI agents built with Google Cloud's AI platform, Vertex AI, to help customer service teams respond with greater speed, coordination, and precision.\n- **Future-ready infrastructure** that consolidates all current on-site data center tenancies by migrating VMware environments onto Google Cloud, enabling more agile service delivery with dramatically reduced operating costs.\n- **Stronger skills** through the Google Cloud Skills Boost program, to equip teams with key proficiencies in data and AI for long-term relevance in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.\n**Insignia Financial's Chief Technology Officer, Damien O\u2019Donnell**, commented: \"Our expanded use of Google Cloud demonstrates Insignia Financial's ongoing focus on AI adoption and strategic innovation. This collaboration enables us to be more efficient, leveraging our data and intellectual property to deliver better outcomes for clients.\n\"Google Cloud\u2019s agentic AI capabilities, supported by our seamless data layer made possible with BigQuery, will empower our customer service teams to make high-touch, highly-personalized experiences accessible to every member. At the same time, consolidating our previous VMware environments from three data center tenancies onto Google Cloud will dramatically reduce our on-premise footprint and its associated costs, with minimal disruption to applications and services\u2014allowing us to focus even more on the crucial work of enhancing our member experience with assurance that our data is as secure and seamless to manage as possible.\"\nInsignia Financial expects the migration to significantly reduce complexity and manual effort associated with maintaining critical applications, while strengthening cybersecurity and compliance. Tighter integration with its BigQuery data lake is also expected to drive benefits, supporting Insignia Financial's readiness for AI adoption at scale.\n**Insignia Financial's Chief Customer Officer, Renee Howie**, added: \"As we integrate AI across our business, it is reshaping how we deliver exceptional customer experiences and innovative solutions for the more than 1.5 million Australians we serve. From enhancing adviser productivity to designing personalized, data-driven journeys for our members, AI is helping our customers make confident, informed decisions with ease.\n\"With our deep expertise and scalable capabilities, we\u2019re harnessing data and AI to deliver tailored guidance and advice\u2014driving meaningful outcomes for every member, today and into the future.\"\n**Vice President, Google Cloud Australia & New Zealand, Paul Migliorini**, said: \"Insignia Financial\u2019s approach to modernizing its infrastructure demonstrates discipline not only in cost control, but also in establishing the foundations needed to translate AI into meaningful customer value at speed.\n\"By investing in training and upskilling, Insignia Financial is also priming interest groups and early adopters within its organization to innovate at speed once those foundations are in place. This means the time and effort saved from infrastructure modernization can be meaningfully redirected into driving AI initiatives and creating greater value for its customers and its business.\"\n**About Insignia Financial** With origins dating back to 1846, today Insignia Financial is a leading Australian wealth manager.
