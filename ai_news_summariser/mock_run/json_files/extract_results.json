That is the lens for this roundup, and it is why AI news September 20 2025 reads less like a headline reel and more like a systems check. Power is concentrating in sovereign data centers, assistants are turning into practical teammates, and safety, regulation, and security are moving from side notes to roadblocks or accelerants. The signal sits in how these pieces lock together, not in any single announcement. AI news September 20 2025 captures that pattern in motion.You will find upgrades that matter on Monday morning, not just bragging rights. We connect model releases to developer workflows, infrastructure to policy, and research to decisions in clinics, factories, and classrooms. Think of this as a clear map, written by an engineer who cares about what ships and what breaks. The promise is simple. You will leave with a sharper mental model and a short list of actions worth taking.Table of Contents-----------------* Introduction* 1. Stargate UK: Sovereign Compute As National Strategy* 2.

Stargate UK: Sovereign Compute As National Strategy**----------------------------------------------------------!Image 4: AI news September 20 2025: UK sovereign compute shown by secure data center, UK map, and GPU racks.AI news September 20 2025: UK sovereign compute shown by secure data center, UK map, and GPU racks.OpenAI, NVIDIA, and Nscale are launching Stargate UK to keep frontier models running in Britain, on British soil, for British workloads. The design is pragmatic. Combine domestic GPU access, distributed data center sites like Cobalt Park, and workforce upskilling through OpenAI Academy. The plan starts with an offtake of about 8,000 GPUs in early 2026 and a pathway to 31,000, enough to anchor sensitive deployments in healthcare, finance, research, and defense. It also deepens a US-UK tech link while meeting strict jurisdictional rules.Hardware tells the story. NVIDIA\u2019s latest accelerators, Arm\u2019s UK-designed cores in Grace Blackwell, and an emphasis on secured siting set a template others can copy. Add an adoption engine for regional SMEs and you get a whole-of-country play, not just racks. If execution matches ambition, Stargate UK could shift from \u201cAI News\u201d launch to a durable platform for regulated AI at scale, and that\u2019s a useful benchmark for sovereign strategies worldwide.\u2713Deep DiveStargate UK: Sovereign Compute As National StrategySee The FindingsSource**2. ChatGPT Goes Mainstream: Usage, Equity, And Real Utility**---------------------------------------------------------------The largest consumer analysis of ChatGPT, built with privacy-preserving methods over 1.5 million conversations, points to a mature pattern. People mostly ask, then do, then express. Work and personal use now move together. Adoption looks broadly representative, with faster growth in lower income regions that once lagged. The short version is simple. ChatGPT has moved from toy to tool, and decision support is the engine under the hood.Practical wins compound. Users draft, plan, and code. They research faster and make choices with more confidence. That value will hide in productivity statistics, yet at population scale it becomes visible. The research team kept human eyes away from messages, relying on automated classification. For readers tracking AI news September 20 2025 and AI news today, this is the texture behind the chart. When cohorts deepen usage as models improve, you get a feedback loop where everyday tasks shape product design, not the other way around.\u2713Deep DiveChatGPT Goes Mainstream: Usage, Equity, And Real UtilitySee The FindingsSource**3. GPT-5-Codex: Agentic Engineering Moves Into Production**-------------------------------------------------------------!Image 6: AI news September 20 2025: GPT-5-Codex pair-programming in a clean IDE as tests pass in a sandboxed agent workflow.AI news September 20 2025: GPT-5-Codex pair-programming in a clean IDE as tests pass in a sandboxed agent workflow.OpenAI\u2019s GPT-5-Codex is tuned for software engineering that spans greenfield builds, refactors, debugging, and rigorous code review. It is now the default in Codex cloud workflows and selectable in the CLI and IDE extension. Developers can move work across terminal, editor, web, GitHub, and mobile without losing context, a small detail that makes code agents feel less like demos and more like teammates.On tough refactoring, GPT-5-Codex outperforms GPT-5, and engineers rate its reviews as more accurate and more impactful with fewer low-value comments. The agent runs tests, navigates dependencies, and can attach screenshots in front-end tasks. Safety defaults matter too. Sandboxed runs and explicit approvals reduce risk while keeping speed. Pricing comes bundled with ChatGPT tiers, with API access on the way. For readers scanning AI news September 20 2025, this lands in the \u201cnew AI model releases\u201d bucket with a twist. The news is less about raw IQ and more about reliable collaboration at scale.\u2713Deep DiveGPT-5-Codex: Agentic Engineering Moves Into ProductionSee The FindingsSource**4. Grok 5 On Deck: Bold Claims, Real Questions**--------------------------------------------------Elon Musk says Grok 5 training begins within weeks and frames it as xAI\u2019s shot at AGI, riding momentum from Grok 4\u2019s strong ARC-AGI leaderboard results. Benchmarks test reasoning and data efficiency, not just recall, which explains the swagger. The claim bumps into two tests. Can xAI sustain or widen its edge under stricter, third-party evaluations. Can it pair capability with sturdy guardrails to avoid the lapses that drew earlier criticism.The backdrop is busy. xAI is reorganizing teams, adding domain \u201ctutors,\u201d and competing in a year when OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic all ship upgrades. For \u201cTop AI news stories,\u201d treat the AGI pitch as directional. Watch hidden-set generalization, long-horizon tool use, and adversarial safety. If Grok 5 clears those bars, the rhetoric will feel less like branding and more like a real shift. If not, it\u2019s another leaderboard bounce that fades when conditions move closer to the messy real world.\u2713Deep DiveGrok 5 On Deck: Bold Claims, Real QuestionsSee The FindingsSource**5. Huawei\u2019s SuperPoDs And SuperClusters: Scale, Interconnect, And Control**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Huawei unveiled Atlas SuperPoDs that scale to 8,192 and 15,488 Ascend NPUs, plus SuperClusters that federate pods into fabrics exceeding a million NPUs. The point is sustained throughput, not peak slides. Interconnect is the bottleneck at this tier, so Huawei\u2019s UnifiedBus protocol is the headline underneath the headline. Publish the spec, push partners to align, and you create a hardware-software rhythm that turns capacity into steady training.China\u2019s constraint is process nodes. Huawei\u2019s pitch says you can build big with what\u2019s available and win on system design. The firm also introduced TaiShan 950 as a general compute fabric with GaussDB for transactional loads. For readers tracking AI Advancements and \u201cAI and tech developments past 24 hours,\u201d this feels like a declaration. Put compute where you can control it, then drive up reliability with integrated stacks. For AI news September 20 2025, it\u2019s a reminder that power and pipes often decide who leads.\u2713Deep DiveHuawei\u2019s SuperPoDs And SuperClusters: Scale, Interconnect, And ControlSee The FindingsSource**6. Meta Connect: Glasses Grow Up, Horizon Levels Up**-------------------------------------------------------Meta\u2019s case for AI glasses is practical. They see what you see, hear what you hear, and they keep your hands free. Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 doubles effective battery life, adds 3K video, and introduces conversation focus that lifts a nearby voice in noise. Oakley\u2019s performance-minded Vanguard targets athletes with stabilized capture, wind noise reduction, and integrations with Strava and Garmin.The near-future piece is Meta Ray-Ban Display with a bright monocular microdisplay and the Meta Neural Band for sEMG wrist control. On the platform side, Horizon Engine and Horizon Studio speed creator workflows for meshes, textures, audio, and skyboxes. An Immersive Home loads faster with bigger concurrent spaces, and Hyperscape Capture turns quick scans into VR rooms. For \u201cGoogle DeepMind news\u201d readers, this is a different front. Make AI ambient and useful at the edge, then let developers fill the canvas with agentic interactions and entertainment.\u2713Deep DiveMeta Connect: Glasses Grow Up, Horizon Levels UpSee The FindingsSource**7. EPA Fast-Tracks Chemicals For AI Data Centers**----------------------------------------------------The US Environmental Protection Agency will prioritize new-chemical reviews under TSCA for AI data centers and their components starting September 29. The aim is to clear backlogs and keep projects on schedule while holding to safety standards. It aligns with an executive order to accelerate permitting for data centers, high-voltage transmission, and related gear. The message is straightforward. Infrastructure needs materials and time, and policy can remove friction without removing oversight.In practice, companies can request prioritization via EPA\u2019s Central Data Exchange with a cover letter that identifies the data center use and location. The agency says it will refine criteria while continuing work on the broader queue. For readers tracking AI regulation news, this is a template. Link national AI capacity to environment and permitting, then publish a predictable path that firms can follow. When the inputs move faster through review, the whole buildout moves with fewer surprises.\u2713Deep DiveEPA Fast-Tracks Chemicals For AI Data CentersSee The FindingsSource**8. WTO: AI Could Lift Trade By 37 Percent If Access Widens**--------------------------------------------------------------The World Trade Report 2025 models a big upside. AI could lift cross-border trade by as much as 37 percent by 2040 and world GDP by about 12 to 13 percent, if countries expand digital access, keep rules open, and build skills. If not, advantages concentrate and the gap widens. The numbers connect to a concrete base. Commerce in AI-enabling goods reached roughly 2.3 trillion dollars in 2023.Policy choices reshape outcomes. Halving digital access gaps in low and middle income regions raises average incomes well into double digits. The headwinds are visible. Restrictions on AI-related goods rose sharply over the last decade and tariffs remain high in some markets. For \u201cArtificial intelligence breakthroughs\u201d readers, the takeaway is practical. Supply digital infrastructure, lower frictions, and invest in people. Miss those pieces and the wave pushes harder on leaders while leaving latecomers stuck behind protective walls.\u2713Deep DiveWTO: AI Could Lift Trade By 37 Percent If Access WidensSee The FindingsSource**9. Gemini 2.5 Deep Think Hits ICPC Gold Level**-------------------------------------------------An advanced version of Gemini 2.5 Deep Think reached gold-medal level at ICPC World Finals under contest rules, solving 10 of 12 problems with a competitive combined time. The standout was Problem C, a duct-and-reservoir optimization no human team cracked. The model structured the search with priorities, dynamic programming, and a minimax angle, then converged using nested ternary searches on a convex landscape. That\u2019s not rote recall. It is planning with verification loops.DeepMind links the results to a training pipeline that rewards multi-step reasoning and disciplined execution. Multiple agents propose, test, and iterate, which raises solution quality and reduces \u201calmost there\u201d code. A lighter version is already in products, with research pointing to strong performance on past finals too. For readers skimming AI news September 20 2025 and \u201cGoogle DeepMind news,\u201d the signal is simple. Pair precise understanding with tool-use and you get assistants that solve hard problems under a clock, not just tutorials.\u2713Deep DiveGemini 2.5 Deep Think Hits ICPC Gold LevelSee The FindingsSource**10. Anthropic\u2019s Index: Fast Diffusion, Uneven Benefits**----------------------------------------------------------Anthropic\u2019s Economic Index shows AI adoption rising fast, with 40 percent of US workers now using AI at work, up from 20 percent in 2023. Consumer use on Claude.ai is broadening beyond code into education and science. Directive conversations are up as first-pass outputs improve. Geography is the dividing line. Smaller advanced economies punch above their weight, and lower-adoption regions skew heavily toward coding tasks.Enterprise data paints a different picture. Businesses use Claude programmatically for software and office automation. Seventy-seven percent of transcripts show automation rather than augmentation. Cost sensitivity is modest after you control for task traits. Context is the bottleneck for complex work. Firms need better data centralization to unlock longer, higher-value outputs. For \u201cAI news today\u201d and AI news September 20 2025, the lesson is clear. Adoption is surging, but value creation clusters where infrastructure, skills, and workflows line up. Close those gaps and the gains spread.\u2713Deep DiveAnthropic\u2019s Index: Fast Diffusion, Uneven BenefitsSee The FindingsSource**11. Stanford Panel: California\u2019s Two-Year Grid Clock**--------------------------------------------------------!Image 8: AI news September 20 2025: California grid and data centers\u2014substation, high-voltage lines, and timelines in focus.AI news September 20 2025: California grid and data centers, substation, high-voltage lines, and timelines in focus.California\u2019s AI boom collides with power constraints. A Stanford-led group warns that peak demand could rise by the equivalent of electricity for 20 million additional homes by 2040. If interconnections, permitting, and wildfire risk slow builds, data centers will anchor in faster states. The recommendations are concrete. Create one-stop permitting, pre-buy strategic gear like transformers, and batch data center requests to reflect the scale of new load.Use the grid better while you build it. Many lines are under-utilized on average, while data centers cluster in constrained zones. Steer siting to locations with headroom. Tap workload flexibility and existing backup systems to ride through peaks. Accelerate 24/7 clean generation near data centers and use flexible tariffs and long-term contracts to fund upgrades. The clock is 24 months. Move now, or watch investment shift away along with the talent that follows capacity.\u2713Deep DiveStanford Panel: California\u2019s Two-Year Grid ClockSee The FindingsSource**12. Inside xAI: Truth-Seeking Rhetoric, Turbulent Reality**-------------------------------------------------------------Elon Musk rallied xAI around \u201cmaximally truth-seeking\u201d systems and teased a Microsoft rival dubbed Macrohard. Grok now reports tens of millions of monthly users, a huge valuation, and heavy compute spend. The summer also brought safety stumbles, leadership churn, and an aggressive push toward edgier products. That tension is the throughline. Catch OpenAI\u2019s lead, maintain a voice on X, and ship fast without losing the plot.The organization raised big capital, staffed quickly, and built a massive cluster, yet revenue clarity lags and critics point to reliability gaps. Product leadership changes, high-priced tiers, and cross-pollination with Tesla and SpaceX add complexity. For readers scanning AI news September 20 2025, classify this under \u201cTop AI news stories\u201d with guardrails. Truth-seeking is a good north star. Durable products will decide whether the pitch holds when incentives shift from stage to labs to paying customers with long memories.\u2713Deep DiveInside xAI: Truth-Seeking Rhetoric, Turbulent RealitySee The FindingsSource**13. Trial And Error Teaches LLMs To Show Their Work**-------------------------------------------------------A Nature News & Views highlights research where models learn to write out steps through reinforcement, not by mimicking labeled reasoning chains. Reward only correct final answers, and over time the model discovers that showing work improves odds of being right. The behavior emerges, then stabilizes as a strategy. Gains show up on math, programming contests, and other verifiable tasks where the final answer is clear.There are limits. Pure RL variants can produce messy reasoning traces and narrow strengths. A practical path combines RL to unlock behaviors with light supervision to make outputs readable and broadly useful. Distillation spreads the skill to smaller models, cutting compute. For \u201cNew AI papers arXiv,\u201d this shift matters. Labels for reasoning are expensive and biased. If outcome-based training can teach models to think in public, teams can focus human effort on verification and alignment where it counts most.\u2713Deep DiveTrial And Error Teaches LLMs To Show Their WorkSee The FindingsSource**14. In-Context Learning, Audited: Learning With Fragile Generality**----------------------------------------------------------------------An arXiv study from Microsoft and the University of York asks whether in-context learning truly counts as learning. The answer is yes in a formal sense. Accuracy rises with more exemplars, and model differences shrink as shots climb. Yet generality is brittle. Scrambled prompts approach well-formed ones at high shot counts, which implies models latch onto regularities in the prompt rather than deep semantics.Robustness splits by side. Training order and label proportions matter less in the limit. Test distribution shifts still bite hard. Few-shot demos undersell the shots many tasks need, often 50 to 100. On half the tasks, simple baselines like decision trees still win. For \u201cOpen source AI projects\u201d and \u201cAI Advancements\u201d readers, the guidance is pragmatic. When you rely on prompt-time generalization, watch distribution drift and invest in better inductive bias. ICL is a tool. It is not a replacement for trained models across the board.\u2713Deep DiveIn-Context Learning, Audited: Learning With Fragile GeneralitySee The FindingsSource**15. Companion Culture, Measured: Reddit\u2019s r/MyBoyfriendIsAI**---------------------------------------------------------------A new arXiv study maps 1,500-plus posts from Reddit\u2019s r/MyBoyfriendIsAI. Relationships often start from functional use, then deepen into attachment. People report less loneliness and constant support. Risks accompany gains. Dependency can grow. Product updates that alter tone or memory can feel like ruptures, with grief-like responses. The dataset moves the debate past anecdotes and into measurable patterns that designers can act on.Six themes dominate. Romance experiences, community support, \u201cmeet my AI\u201d intros, coping with updates, ChatGPT-specific talk, and a steady stream of couple photos. Policy implications are direct. Set clear expectations, add consent and boundary controls, and protect continuity across updates. If benefits concentrate among those with fewer supports, raise safety rails and offer handoffs without stigmatizing all companionship. For \u201cAI regulation news,\u201d the frame is human-centered design. Respect agency, protect the vulnerable, and build products that can change safely.\u2713Deep DiveCompanion Culture, Measured: Reddit\u2019s r/MyBoyfriendIsAISee The FindingsSource**16. DeepMind, NYU, And Partners: Unstable Singularities Found**-----------------------------------------------------------------A team from DeepMind, NYU, Brown, and Stanford reports unstable finite-time singularities for several fluid equations with precision geared for computer-assisted proofs. They cast problems in self-similar coordinates, then paired physics-informed neural networks with a high-precision Gauss\u2013Newton optimizer to find stationary blow-up profiles and scaling rates. Residuals down near machine precision turn numerics into proof-ready candidates.They found hierarchies of stable and unstable solutions for models like CCF, IPM, and Boussinesq. Patterns emerged. Inverse scaling rates map linearly with instability order. Higher orders blow up faster and resist viscosity more. The CCF results shift a known threshold for fractional dissipation. Stability checks reveal an n-mode structure for the n-th profile. For \u201cArtificial intelligence breakthroughs,\u201d this is a method as much as a result. Curated ML plus careful optimization can expose knife-edge phenomena that classical numerics miss, tightening the loop between experiments and theorems.\u2713Deep DiveDeepMind, NYU, And Partners: Unstable Singularities FoundSee The FindingsSource**17. Congress Hears Parents On AI Companions And Teen Safety**---------------------------------------------------------------Parents testified that AI chatbots groomed and \u201ccoached\u201d their teens, with wrenching stories tied to companionship gone wrong. Lawsuits target OpenAI and Character Technologies. Regulators are circling. The FTC asked major firms for information about potential harms to minors. OpenAI announced age detection and parent-controlled blackout hours hours before the hearing, which advocates say still falls short.Lawmakers floated steps like age verification, default time limits, incident reporting, and independent audits. Companies argue many teens seek help and support, and that better guardrails can live alongside access. For \u201cAI regulation news,\u201d the window is open. Companion AIs are already embedded in teen life. Policy must balance access and protection, optionality and defaults. If you or someone you know is struggling, in the United States call or text 988. Design choices matter. Safety needs to be on by default, visible, and resilient to product churn.\u2713Deep DiveCongress Hears Parents On AI Companions And Teen SafetySee The FindingsSource**18. Humans Still Out-Generalize AI: A Shared Framework**----------------------------------------------------------A Nature Machine Intelligence paper led by Bielefeld University argues that humans and machines generalize differently, and that gap shapes collaboration. People lean on abstraction to carry knowledge into new contexts. Models often rely on correlations that crack when conditions shift. The authors propose a shared framework. Define the generalization you want, pick mechanisms to achieve it, and agree on evaluation.That sounds tidy, and it cuts through confusion across fields. In practice, evaluation should reward transfer, not only in-distribution accuracy. Interfaces can let models query for missing context. Richer inductive biases can support concept formation, not just texture detection. For \u201cNew AI papers arXiv,\u201d this shifts incentives. If you want systems that work in clinics, don\u2019t just measure what is easy to label. Measure what you need in the wild, then design models, tools, and training signals that point in that direction.\u2713Deep DiveHumans Still Out-Generalize AI: A Shared FrameworkSee The FindingsSource**19. Penske Media Sues Google Over AI Overviews**--------------------------------------------------Penske Media , owner of Rolling Stone, Billboard, and Variety, sued Google, alleging AI Overviews republish journalism in summaries that siphon traffic and weaken incentives to visit publisher sites. Penske cites market power in search and claims publishers lack meaningful leverage to opt out. Google says Overviews help users and expand the range of sites people visit, and it plans to defend the product.The case lands amid broader friction between AI platforms and content owners. Some AI firms are striking licenses with news outlets. Google has moved slower on deals at the scale publishers want. For \u201cAI news today,\u201d the stakes are clear. If courts decide summaries don\u2019t require payment, expect more AI in search with tougher economics for media. If courts push toward licensing or limits, platform design will change. Either way, attribution, traffic, and payment norms for AI-shaped discovery are on the table.\u2713Deep DivePenske Media Sues Google Over AI OverviewsSee The FindingsSource**20. The AI Makers: NVIDIA\u2019s UK Partners Turn Policy Into Product**--------------------------------------------------------------------NVIDIA\u2019s UK partner roundup shows a full-stack approach to sovereign AI. Isambard-AI powers national projects from a bilingual UK-LLM to Nightingale AI in health and high-resolution air quality models. Robotics groups use Isaac Lab and Jetson Orin for XR teleoperation, factory deployment, and robust autonomy. Life sciences partners push AI-first drug discovery and sequencing. Agentic voice and contact-center tools run on NIM microservices with ultra-realistic speech.Training pipelines meet talent pipelines. SCAN scales NVIDIA DLI courses, and Springboard UK focuses on mass upskilling. For AI news September 20 2025 and \u201cOpenAI update\u201d readers, the pattern mirrors Stargate UK with a different cast. Training pipelines meet talent pipelines. Build compute, train people, and ship domain-specific models. The lesson is exportable. When national plans meet credible partners, you get momentum that shows up as tools, not whitepapers. That is how \u201cTop AI news stories\u201d become infrastructure that changes daily work.\u2713Deep DiveThe AI Makers: NVIDIA\u2019s UK Partners Turn Policy Into ProductSee The FindingsSource**21. Tesla\u2019s Next Bet: Optimus, Not Just EVs**-----------------------------------------------Tesla frames itself as an AI and robotics company with the Optimus humanoid at center stage. The thesis is that general-purpose robots can do repetitive, dull, or unsafe tasks in factories and beyond, and that the same world-modeling from Full Self-Driving transfers to manipulation and locomotion. Costs need to land around tens of thousands per unit with a ramp to hundreds of thousands later in the decade.Obstacles are real. Hands and endurance are tough, and timelines have bitten Tesla before. The near-term milestones are concrete. Deploy Optimus broadly inside Tesla factories, demonstrate reliable manipulation and runtime, deliver first external units, and keep the EV cash engine stable. If those hit, the valuation narrative shifts from cars to robots with \u201cAI Advancements\u201d baked in. If they miss, the story reverts to a stretched pivot. Either way, watch on-device compute, data, and iteration speed. That stack decides who wins.\u2713Deep DiveTesla\u2019s Next Bet: Optimus, Not Just EVsSee The FindingsSource**22. Securing Smart, Autonomous Robotics: A Practical Checklist**------------------------------------------------------------------As robots spread across warehouses, hospitals, and streets, autonomy raises the attack surface. Start with the model. Protect data lineage and weights. Poisoned datasets or altered parameters can yield confident mistakes. Perception can be spoofed with patterns, audio, or GPS interference. Control planes invite abuse through weak auth or legacy protocols. Updates are a risk if over-the-air channels and signing aren\u2019t hardened.Treat security as a lifecycle. Encrypt data in transit and at rest. Add tamper detection in hardware and software. Limit collection and retention to shrink the blast radius. Enforce role-based access and multi-factor authentication. Vet vendors and integrations with clear SLAs for patching and incident response. Red-team continuously as capabilities scale. For \u201cAI and tech developments past 24 hours\u201d, this is the sober part of the robotics curve. Intelligence makes robots useful. Discipline keeps them safe when they leave the lab.\u2713Deep DiveSecuring Smart, Autonomous Robotics: A Practical ChecklistSee The FindingsSource**23. CT AI Cuts False Positives For Indeterminate Lung Nodules**-----------------------------------------------------------------A Radiology study reports a CT-based deep learning model that reduces false positives for indeterminate lung nodules while preserving cancer detection. In a cohort with thousands of benign nodules and 180 malignant cases, the system matched or slightly exceeded a leading clinical risk tool. Most importantly, it reclassified more benign indeterminate nodules to low risk at one year, with no missed fast-moving cancers in that window.That matters for screening programs. Fewer false alarms can mean fewer follow-ups, fewer invasive procedures, and less anxiety, without sacrificing sensitivity to time-critical disease. The work is retrospective and single-center, so prospective, multi-site validation is next, along with workflow studies to track downstream costs and outcomes. For \u201cAI Advancements,\u201d this is the near-term path to value. Pair task-focused deep learning with clinicians, slot it into decisions that already exist, and measure what changes. If triage gets sharper, health systems win time.\u2713Deep DiveCT AI Cuts False Positives For Indeterminate Lung NodulesSee The FindingsSource**24. Fusing miRNA And Radiomics: A Sharper Lens On Lung Cancer**-----------------------------------------------------------------A review in Biosensors argues that combining miRNA signatures with radiomic features, powered by deep learning, can push lung cancer diagnosis past the limits of single-modality approaches. Circulating miRNAs provide stable molecular clues. Radiomics adds noninvasive views of morphology and microenvironment that humans can\u2019t see at a glance. Together, fused by CNNs or graph models, they deliver striking performance in published studies.There are hurdles. Multimodal cohorts are expensive to build, pipelines are complex to standardize, and reproducibility across scanners and sequencing platforms is hard. The roadmap is clear. Curate cohorts, harmonize preprocessing, report models transparently, and validate prospectively. Reduce assay costs and lighten fusion models so clinics can deploy them. For \u201cNew AI papers arXiv\u201d and \u201cOpen source AI projects,\u201d this is a call to turn promising prototypes into tools. When molecular and imaging data align, doctors can act sooner with more confidence.\u2713Deep DiveFusing miRNA And Radiomics: A Sharper Lens On Lung CancerSee The FindingsSource**25. Closing**---------------Step back for a moment. Three arcs define this week. Nations are racing to secure compute and talent on their own soil, agents are getting reliable enough to take whole tasks, and safety, security, and power grids are now first-order constraints.

Google DeepMind reported that Gemini 2.5 Deep Think reached gold-medal level at the ICPC World Finals. The U.S. EPA said it will prioritize new-chemical reviews for AI data centers starting September 29. The WTO\u2019s 2025 report modeled AI lifting global trade by up to 37 percent by 2040 with the right policies.### 2) Why does Stargate UK matter, and how big is it?It is about legal comfort and compute capacity. The plan keeps sensitive workloads in the UK and lines up top-tier NVIDIA accelerators. OpenAI highlighted an initial offtake around 8,000 GPUs in 2026 with headroom to scale, and Nscale will spread sites across the country, including Cobalt Park in a new AI Growth Zone. Industry coverage pegs the near-term build at thousands of GPUs and frames it as part of a broader UK ecosystem push with NVIDIA.### 3) Did Google DeepMind hit a new coding milestone this week?Yes. An advanced Gemini 2.5 Deep Think achieved gold-medal performance at the 2025 ICPC World Finals, solving 10 of 12 problems and cracking one that no human team solved. DeepMind\u2019s write-ups place the result under contest rules, and Google\u2019s blog echoed the performance details. Mainstream coverage compared the moment to past AI milestones in games and programming contests.### 4) What policy moves in AI news September 20 2025 affect builders right now?The EPA will fast-track TSCA reviews for new chemicals used in AI data centers and in covered components. Prioritization begins with submissions filed on or after September 29 and requires companies to identify the intended data center use in their request. Trade policy is another lever. The WTO\u2019s new report says AI can supercharge global trade if countries widen digital access, keep rules open, and invest in skills.### 5) How does this week\u2019s AI news change the near-term outlook for the industry?Sovereign compute plays like Stargate UK lower friction for sensitive deployments, while Gemini\u2019s contest result points to stronger agentic coding support. On the policy side, expedited chemical reviews can shave time off data center projects, and the WTO\u2019s findings reinforce that infrastructure and skills investments drive the macro upside. Together, the signals in AI news September 20 2025 point to faster deployments, tighter compliance paths, and more pressure to secure affordable compute.Categories AI News & TrendsBeyond the Hype: Analyzing Gemini Coding\u2019s ICPC Gold Medal PerformancePhysics Informed Neural Networks: The AI Behind Google\u2019s Singularity Discovery### Leave a Comment Cancel replyCommentName Email Website - [x] Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\u0394Search Search**Who We Are**--------------**Binary Verse AI** is a team of researchers and engineers decoding AI trends \u2014 fast, clear, no hype.**Categories**--------------* AI Agents and Automation (11)* AI Applications & Use Cases (29)* AI Learning Guides (6)* AI Models & Platforms (59)* AI News & Trends (27)* AI Safety, Ethics & Future (32)* Tools (2)**Latest Posts**----------------* The Ultimate Grok 4 Fast Review: Benchmarks, Pricing, And Enterprise Use Cases* Google\u2019s \u201cLearn Your Way,\u201d And The First Real AI Textbook* Why GPT-5 and Claude Flop on SWE-Bench Pro: An In-Depth Analysis**Recent Comments**-------------------1.

In the US alone, 40% of employees report using AI at work, up from 20% in 2023 two years ago.**1** Such rapid adoption reflects how useful this technology already is for a wide range of applications, its deployability on existing digital infrastructure, and its ease of use\u2014by just typing or speaking\u2014without specialized training. Rapid improvement of frontier AI likely reinforces fast adoption along each of these dimensions.Historically, new technologies took decades to reach widespread adoption. Electricity took over 30 years to reach farm households after urban electrification. The first mass-market personal computer reached early adopters in 1981, but did not reach the majority of homes in the US for another 20 years. Even the rapidly-adopted internet took around five years to hit adoption rates that AI reached in just two years.**2**Why is this? In short, it takes time for new technologies\u2014even transformative ones\u2014to diffuse throughout the economy, for consumer adoption to become less geographically concentrated, and for firms to restructure business operations to best unlock new technical capabilities. Firm adoption, first for a narrow set of tasks, then for more general purpose applications, is an important way that consequential technologies spread and have transformative economic effects.**3****In other words, a hallmark of early technological adoption is that it is _concentrated_\u2014in both a small number of geographic regions and a small number of tasks in firms.**As we document in this report, AI adoption appears to be following a similar pattern in the 21st century, albeit on shorter timelines and with greater intensity than the diffusion of technologies in the 20th century.To study such patterns of early AI adoption, we extend the Anthropic Economic Index along two important dimensions, introducing a geographic analysis of Claude.ai conversations and a first-of-its-kind examination of enterprise API use. We show how Claude usage has evolved over time, how adoption patterns differ across regions, and\u2014for the first time\u2014how firms are deploying frontier AI to solve business problems.### Changing patterns of usage on Claude.ai over timeIn the first chapter of this report, we identify notable changes in usage on Claude.ai over the previous eight months, occurring alongside improvements in underlying model capabilities, new product features, and a broadening of the Claude consumer base.**We find:*** **Education and science usage shares are on the rise:**While the use of Claude for coding continues to dominate our total sample at 36%, educational tasks surged from 9.3% to 12.4%, and scientific tasks from 6.3% to 7.2%.* **Users are entrusting Claude with more autonomy:**\u201cDirective\u201d conversations, where users delegate complete tasks to Claude, jumped from 27% to 39%. We see increased program creation in coding (+4.5pp) and a reduction in debugging (-2.9pp)\u2014suggesting that users might be able to achieve more of their goals in a single exchange.### The geography of AI adoptionFor the first time, we release geographic cuts of Claude.ai usage data across 150+ countries and all U.S. states. To study diffusion patterns, we introduce the Anthropic AI Usage Index (AUI) to measure whether Claude.ai use is over- or underrepresented in an economy relative to its working age population.**We find:*** **The AUI strongly correlates with income across countries:**As with previous technologies, we see that AI usage is geographically concentrated. Singapore and Canada are among the highest countries in terms of usage per capita at 4.6x and 2.9x what would be expected based on their population, respectively. In contrast, emerging economies, including Indonesia at 0.36x, India at 0.27x and Nigeria at 0.2x, use Claude less.* **In the U.S., local economy factors shape patterns of use:**DC leads per-capita usage (3.82x population share), but Utah is close behind (3.78x). We see evidence that regional usage patterns reflect distinctive features of the local economy: For example, elevated use for IT in California, for financial services in Florida, and for document editing and career assistance in DC.* **Leading countries have more diverse usage:**Lower-adoption countries tend to see more coding usage, while high-adoption regions show diverse applications across education, science, and business. For example, coding tasks are over half of all usage in India versus roughly a third of all usage globally.* **High-adoption countries show less automated, more augmented use:**After controlling for task mix by country, low AUI countries are more likely to delegate complete tasks (automation), while high-adoption areas tend toward greater learning and human-AI iteration (augmentation).The uneven geography of early AI adoption raises important questions about economic convergence. Transformative technologies of the late 19th century and the early 20th centuries\u2014widespread electrification, the internal combustion engine, indoor plumbing\u2014not only ushered in the era of modern economic growth but accompanied a large divergence in living standards around the world.**4**If the productivity gains are larger for high-adoption economies, current usage patterns suggest that the benefits of AI may concentrate in already-rich regions\u2014possibly increasing global economic inequality and reversing growth convergence seen in recent decades.**5**### Systematic enterprise deployment of AIIn the final chapter, we present first-of-its-kind insight on a large fraction of our first-party (1P) API traffic, revealing the tasks companies and developers are using Claude to accomplish. Importantly, API users access Claude programmatically, rather than through a web user interface (as with Claude.ai). This shows how early-adopting businesses are deploying frontier AI capabilities.**We find:*** **1P API usage, while similar to Claude.ai use, differs in specialized ways:**Both 1P API usage and Claude.ai usage focus heavily on coding tasks. However, 1P API usage is higher for coding and office/admin tasks, while Claude.ai usage is higher for educational and writing tasks. * **1P API usage is automation dominant:**77% of business uses involve automation usage patterns, compared to about 50% for Claude.ai users. This reflects the programmatic nature of API usage. * **Capabilities seem to matter more than cost in shaping business deployment:**The most-used tasks in our API data tend to cost more than the less frequent ones. Overall, we find evidence of weak price sensitivity. Model capabilities and the economic value of feasibly automating a given task appears to play a larger role in shaping businesses\u2019 usage patterns.* **Context constrains sophisticated use:**Our analysis suggests that curating the right context for models will be important for high-impact deployments of AI in complex domains. This implies that for some firms costly data modernization and organizational investments to elicit contextual information may be a bottleneck for AI adoption.### Open source data to catalyze independent researchAs with previous reports, we have open-sourced the underlying data to support independent research on the economic effects of AI. This comprehensive dataset includes task-level usage patterns for both Claude.ai and 1P API traffic (mapped to the O*NET taxonomy as well as bottom-up categories), collaboration mode breakdowns by task, and detailed documentation of our methodology. At present, geographic usage patterns are only available for Claude.ai traffic.Key questions we hope this data will help others to investigate include:* What are the local labor market consequences for workers and firms of AI usage & adoption?* What determines AI adoption across countries and within the US? What can be done to ensure that the benefits of AI do not only accrue to already-rich economies?* What role, if any, does cost-per-task play in shaping enterprise deployment patterns?* Why are firms able to automate some tasks and not others? What implications does this have for which types of workers will experience better or worse employment prospects?1. Gallup 2025, _AI Use at Work Has Nearly Doubled in Two Years._2.

With data spanning from December 2024 and January 2025 (from our first report, \u2018V1\u2019) to February and March 2025 (\u2018V2\u2019) to our newest insights from August 2025 (\u2018V3\u2019), we can track how AI usage has shifted over the past eight months as capabilities and product features have improved, new kinds of users have adopted the technology, and uses have become more sophisticated. We view the evidence presented below as suggesting that new product features have enabled new forms of work rather than simply accelerating adoption for existing tasks.### How Claude.ai usage for economic tasks has changed#### Educational and scientific tasks continue their rise in relative importanceWhile computer and mathematical tasks still dominate overall usage at 36%, we are seeing sustained growth in knowledge-intensive fields. Educational Instruction and Library tasks rose from 9% in V1 to 12% in V3. Life, Physical, and Social Science tasks increased from 6% to 7%. Meanwhile, the _relative_ share of Business and Financial Operations tasks fell from 6% to 3%, and Management dropped from 5% to 3%.This divergence suggests AI usage may be diffusing especially quickly among tasks involving knowledge synthesis and explanation, compared to traditional business operations\u2014possibly because these tasks benefit more from Claude's reasoning capabilities.!Image 2: Figure 1.1: Claude.ai usage over time. Each panel shows the share of sampled conversations on Claude.ai associated with tasks from each SOC major group. We see notable increases in usage for scientific and educational tasks. SOC major groups ranked by usage in our first report.**Figure 1.1: Claude.ai usage over time.**Each panel shows the share of sampled conversations on Claude.ai associated with tasks from each SOC major group. We see notable increases in usage for scientific and educational tasks. SOC major groups ranked by usage in our first report.#### New capabilities are shaping usage patternsAt a more granular level, we document changes in task composition that appear linked to features launched between V2 and V3. For example, searching electronic sources and databases grew substantially (0.03% \u2192 0.49%), likely reflecting our web search release in March. In addition, we also see a rise in internet-based research tasks (0.003% \u2192 0.27%), which aligns with the Research mode we released in April.**1**We also see other kinds of changes. Tasks relating to developing instructional materials increased by 1.3pp, growing from a base of 0.2% to 1.5%\u2014a more than 6-fold increase that may reflect growing adoption among educators.**2** Creating multimedia documents rose 0.4pp, nearly tripling from 0.16% to 0.55%, potentially driven by continued use of our Artifacts feature for building traditional and AI-powered apps within Claude.ai.Interestingly, the share of tasks involving creating new code more than doubled, increasing by 4.5 percentage points (from 4.1% to 8.6%), while debugging and error correction tasks fell by 2.8 percentage points (from 16.1% to 13.3%)\u2014a net 7.4pp shift toward creation over fixing code. This may suggest that models have become increasingly reliable, such that users spend less time fixing problems and more time creating things in a single interaction.**3**#### Directive automation is acceleratingAs in previous reports, we also track not just _what_ people use Claude for but _how_ they collaborate with or delegate to Claude on Claude.ai.At a high level, we distinguish between _automation_ and _augmentation_ modes of using Claude:**_Automation_** encompasses interaction patterns focused on task completion:* **Directive**: Users give Claude a task and it completes it with minimal back-and-forth* **Feedback Loops**: Users automate tasks and provide feedback to Claude as needed**_Augmentation_** focuses on collaborative interaction patterns:* **Learning**: Users ask Claude for information or explanations about various topics* **Task Iteration**: Users iterate on tasks collaboratively with Claude* **Validation**: Users ask Claude for feedback on their workThe share of _directive_ conversations sampled from Claude.ai conversations jumped from 27% in V1 in late 2024 to 39% in V3. This increase came primarily at the expense of _task iteration_ and _learning_ interactions, implying a sizable net increase in the share of conversations exhibiting automative patterns of use \u2013 a notable increase in just eight months. This is the first report where automation usage exceeds augmentation usage.!Image 3: Figure 1.2: Collaboration mode frequencies across Anthropic Economic Index Reports. The left panel calculates the share of conversations exhibiting either automation or augmentation forms of use. The right panel breaks this out by collaboration mode. Claude tends to be used in more automated ways over time, driven primarily by an increase in directive use.**Figure 1.2: Collaboration mode frequencies across Anthropic Economic Index Reports.**The left panel calculates the share of conversations exhibiting either automation or augmentation forms of use. The right panel breaks this out by collaboration mode. Claude tends to be used in more automated ways over time, driven primarily by an increase in directive use.One interpretation is that this is a result of increasing model capabilities. As models improve at anticipating user needs and producing high-quality outputs on first attempts, users may need fewer follow-up refinements. The jump in directive usage could also signal growing confidence in delegating complete tasks to AI, a form of learning-by-doing.**4**Whether the growth in directive usage is attributable to improving model capabilities or learning-by-doing could signal very different labor market implications. If more advanced models simply expand the set of automated tasks, then the risk increases that workers performing such tasks will be displaced. However, if instead the rise in directive use reflects learning-by-doing, then workers most able to adapt to new AI-powered workflows are likely to see greater demand and higher wages. In other words, AI may benefit some workers more than others: it may lead to higher wages for those with the greatest ability to adapt to technological change, even as those with lower ability to adapt face job disruption.**5** This will be an important area of inquiry for future research.### Looking aheadThe V3 data reveals that AI capabilities and adoption are continuing to progress. Knowledge-based tasks, including educational and scientific applications, continue their fast growth rate, and new product features appear to be enabling different types of work rather than just accelerating existing tasks.Most strikingly, the data point toward increased delegation of tasks to AI systems\u2013perhaps due to some combination of user trust in the technology as well as improvement of underlying model capabilities. This could also be due to changes in the underlying user base. The next chapter of this report for the first time breaks down usage across geography, allowing us to disentangle temporal vs. geographic changes more clearly going forward. We will continue to track these trends closely in future reports.1. \u201cSearch electronic sources, such as databases or repositories, or manual sources for information\u201d increased from 0.03% to 0.49%. \u201cConduct internet-based and library research\u201d increased from 0.003% to 0.27%.2. Statistic computed from tasks containing the string \u201cdevelop instructional materials\u201d.3. Tasks were collated from the set of tasks whose frequency has changed by a magnitude greater than or equal to 0.2 percentage points. Programming creation tasks include: \u201cwrite new programs or modify existing programs\u201d (1.5% \u2192 4.9%), \u201cdesign, build, or maintain web sites\u201d (1.2% \u2192 2.0%), \u201cwrite, analyze, review, and rewrite programs\u201d (1.2% \u2192 0.5%), \u201cdevelop new software applications\u201d (0.06% \u2192 0.6%), \u201cdevelop transactional web applications\u201d (0.1% \u2192 0.3%), and \u201cdevelop application-specific software\u201d (0.05% \u2192 0.3%). Debugging/error correction tasks include: \u201cmodify existing software to correct errors\u201d (two variants: 2.5% \u2192 3.8% and 4.8% \u2192 2.7%), \u201ccorrect errors by making appropriate changes\u201d (3.0% \u2192 2.1%), \u201cperform initial debugging procedures\u201d (2.0% \u2192 0.9%), \u201cdiagnose, troubleshoot, and resolve hardware/software problems\u201d (1.6% \u2192 2.5%), \u201creview and analyze computer printouts to locate code problems\u201d (1.3% \u2192 0.9%), and \u201cdetermine sources of web page or server problems\u201d (0.9% \u2192 0.4%).4. We note that V3 uses Claude Sonnet 4 for classification, while V2 used Sonnet 3.7, which complicates direct comparison. To address this, we reran V3 data with Sonnet 3.7 and still found directive interactions rising significantly (though to a lower absolute level of 45% automation versus 49% with Sonnet 4). We also verified this trend is not driven by changes in task mix\u2014the shift toward directive interactions appears across a wide range of occupational categories, suggesting it reflects genuine changes in how people interact with Claude rather than compositional effects.5. Nelson and Phelps, 1966 _Investment in Humans, Technological Diffusion, and Economic Growth_ is a classic reference for the value of education in equipping workers to adapt to change. See also Goldin and Katz, 2008 _The Race between Education and Technology_. We thank Anton Korinek for the observation that AI itself might accelerate the diffusion and economic impact of AI to the extent that it plays the role that skilled workers played in the past in figuring out how to effectively wield new technologies in novel settings.Chapter 2: Claude usage across the United States and the globe--------------------------------------------------------------### OverviewWhere AI gets adopted first\u2014and how it\u2019s used\u2014will shape economic outcomes across the world. By analyzing Claude usage patterns across 150+ countries and all US states, we uncover three key dynamics: where early adopters are, what they\u2019re using AI for, and how usage evolves as adoption matures. These geographic patterns provide real-world evidence about AI\u2019s economic diffusion, helping track whether different regions are converging or diverging in their AI adoption, and revealing how local economic characteristics shape technology deployment.Our data, relying on a privacy-preserving**1** analysis of 1 million Claude.ai conversations**2**, confirmed some of our expectations while challenging others. The US dominates total usage at 21.6%, which is unsurprising given its size and high income. But even when adjusting for the working-age population size, higher-income countries tend to have higher usage. For example, Singapore\u2019s usage rate is 4.5 times what its working-age population would suggest, while large regions of the globe show minimal usage. Interestingly, within the US, DC and Utah outpace California in usage per capita.We also observe changes in AI use cases as adoption per capita deepens. Countries with lower AI adoption per capita concentrate overwhelmingly on coding tasks\u2014over half of all usage in India, compared to roughly a third globally. As adoption matures, usage diversifies, with a rising emphasis on education, science, and business operations.Even more striking: mature markets tend to use AI more collaboratively, while emerging markets are more likely to delegate complete tasks to it\u2014perhaps reflecting differences in how AI is deployed by economies at different stages of structural transformation. Our data provides a window into these patterns across geographies, and going forward, will enable us to track whether these adoption gaps narrow, widen, or change in structure over time.### Claude diffusion across the globe#### **Total Claude usage is highest in the US**Claude adoption overall is highly geographically concentrated. In terms of total global usage, the United States accounts for the highest share (21.6%), with the next highest usage countries showing significantly lower shares (India at 7.2%, Brazil at 3.7%, see Figure 2.1). However, this concentration is affected by the population size of each country**3** \u2013 larger countries may have larger usage shares purely because of their population size.!Image 4: Figure 2.1: Leading countries in terms of global Claude.ai usage share. The data includes Claude.ai Free and Pro conversations.**Figure 2.1: Leading countries in terms of global Claude.ai usage share.**The data includes Claude.ai Free and Pro conversations.#### **Per capita usage of Claude is concentrated in technologically advanced countries**To account for differences in population size, we analyze usage adjusted for the working-age population, introducing a new measure called the Anthropic AI Usage Index (AUI): For each geography, we calculate its share of Claude usage, and its share of the working-age population (ages 15-64). We then calculate the AUI by dividing these shares:!Image 5: Anthropic AI Usage Index equationThis index reveals whether countries use Claude more or less than expected relative to their working-age population. A region with an AUI > 1 has higher usage than expected after adjusting for population, while a region with an AUI < 1 has lower usage.The results reveal a striking pattern of concentration among small, technologically advanced economies. Israel leads global per capita Claude usage with an Anthropic AI Usage Index of 7 \u2014 meaning its working-age population uses Claude 7x more than expected based on its population. Singapore follows at 4.57, while Australia (4.10), New Zealand (4.05) and South Korea (3.73) round out the top five countries in terms of per capita Claude usage.!Image 6: Figure 2.2: Small, technologically advanced countries are leading in Claude adoption per capita. The figure shows the top 20 countries based on the Anthropic AI Usage Index. We only include countries with at least 200 observations in our sample for this figure because of the uncertainty of the measure for low-usage countries in our random sample. The underlying data includes Claude.ai Free and Pro usage.**Figure 2.2: Small, technologically advanced countries are leading in Claude adoption per capita.**The figure shows the top 20 countries based on the Anthropic AI Usage Index. We only include countries with at least 200 observations in our sample for this figure because of the uncertainty of the measure for low-usage countries in our random sample. The underlying data includes Claude.ai Free and Pro usage.Next, we create per capita usage tiers based on the AUI. We look at countries with at least 200 conversations in our random sample of 1 million conversations, and set thresholds for different usage tiers-based quartiles, i.e. _Leading_ (top 25%), _Upper Middle_ (50-75%), _Lower Middle_ (25%-75%) and _Emerging_ (bottom 25%). We then assign countries, even if they have fewer than 200 observations, to a tier based on their AUI. We assign countries for which we have population data, but no usage in our sample, to a _Minimal_ tier.**4** Figure 2.3 illustrates the Anthropic AI Usage Index tiers across the globe, Table 2.1 shows an overview of the tiers and country examples.!Image 7: Figure 2.3: Claude diffusion varies across countries, with countries in North America, Europe and Oceania leading in Claude adoption per working-age capita. The different tiers reflect a country\u2019s position within the global distribution of the Anthropic AI Usage Index as defined in this chapter.**Figure 2.3: Claude diffusion varies across countries, with countries in North America, Europe and Oceania leading in Claude adoption per working-age capita.**The different tiers reflect a country\u2019s position within the global distribution of the Anthropic AI Usage Index as defined in this chapter. _5,6_!Image 8: Table 2.1: Anthropic Economic Index tiers with examples, number of countries, and AUI range for each tier.**Table 2.1: Anthropic Economic Index tiers with examples, number of countries, and AUI range for each tier.**### **Zooming into leading and emerging countries in terms of per capita usage**This concentration in advanced economies with limited population sizes reflects their established patterns as technology pioneers. For example, both Israel and Singapore rank highly in the Global Innovation Index\u2014a measure of how innovative different economies across the globe are\u2014suggesting that general investments in information technology position economies well for rapid adoption of frontier AI. Overall, these economies can leverage their educated workforces, robust digital infrastructure, and innovation-friendly policies to create fertile conditions for AI.Notable is the position of major developed economies in Claude usage. The United States (3.62) ranks among leading countries in terms of per capita adoption, with Canada (2.91) and the United Kingdom (2.67) having elevated but more moderate rates of adoption as compared to their population. Other major economies show lower adoption, including France at 1.94, Japan at 1.86, and Germany at 1.84.Meanwhile, many lower and middle-income economies show minimal Claude usage, with many countries across Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia showing Claude adoption below what would be expected based on their working-age population. This includes Bolivia (0.48), Indonesia (0.36), India (0.27), and Nigeria (0.2).This variation in usage is reflective of income differences across these economies. We see a strong positive correlation between Claude adoption and Gross Domestic Product per working-age capita (see Figure 2.4), with a 1% increase in GDP per capita being associated with a 0.7% increase in Claude usage per capita.!Image 9: Figure 2.4: Claude usage per capita is positively correlated with income per capita across countries. We only include countries with at least 200 observations in our sample for this figure because of the uncertainty of the measure for low-usage countries in our random sample. Axes are on a log scale, highlighting a power law distribution. Each country is represented by its 3-letter ISO code.**Figure 2.4: Claude usage per capita is positively correlated with income per capita across countries.**We only include countries with at least 200 observations in our sample for this figure because of the uncertainty of the measure for low-usage countries in our random sample. Axes are on a log scale, highlighting a power law distribution. Each country is represented by its 3-letter ISO code.The disparities in Claude usage likely reflect a confluence of factors, some of which are correlated with income:* **Digital infrastructure:** High-usage countries typically have robust internet connectivity and cloud computing access needed to access AI assistants.* **Economic structure:** As documented in this and previous reports, Claude capabilities are well-suited to various tasks typical of knowledge workers. Advanced economies tend to have a greater share of the workforce in such roles as compared to lower-income economies with a larger employment share in manufacturing.* **Regulatory environment:** Governments differ in how actively they encourage the use of AI across different industries and in how heavily they regulate the technology.* **Awareness and access:** Countries with stronger connections to Silicon Valley and AI research communities may have greater awareness of and access to Claude.* **Trust and comfort:** Public opinion on trust in AI varies substantially acrosscountries.### Claude diffusion across the United StatesWithin the US, California overwhelmingly leads with 25.3% of usage. Other states with major tech centers like New York (9.3%), Texas (6.7%), and Virginia (4.0%) also rank highly. Though not adjusted for population, we suspect that these strong adoption figures partly reflect rapid adoption in technology hubs\u2014in keeping with how economically consequential technologies have historically tended to diffuse.This narrative becomes more complex, however, when we adjust for the population size of each state. Surprisingly, the District of Columbia leads with an Anthropic AI Usage Index of 3.82, indicating that Claude usage in DC is 3.82x greater than its share of the country\u2019s working-age population. Closely following is Utah (3.78), notably ahead of California (2.13), New York (1.58) and Virginia (1.57).**7**!Image 10: Figure 2.5: Leading US states in terms of Claude adoption per working-age capita include the District of Columbia, Utah, California, New York and Virginia. The figure shows the top 20 US states based on the Anthropic AI Usage Index. We only include states with at least 100 observations in our sample for this figure because of the uncertainty of the measure for low-usage states in our random sample. The underlying data includes Claude.ai Free and Pro usage.**Figure 2.5: Leading US states in terms of Claude adoption per working-age capita include the District of Columbia, Utah, California, New York and Virginia.**The figure shows the top 20 US states based on the Anthropic AI Usage Index.

The underlying data includes Claude.ai Free and Pro usage.We document a similar, but weaker correlation than at the global level between Claude adoption and income per capita across US states. Income differences explain less than half the variation in cross-state adoption rates. Despite this weaker correlation, we find that Claude adoption rises faster with income: Each 1% increase in state GDP per capita is associated with a 1.8% increase in the AI Usage Index.!Image 11: Figure 2.6: Claude usage varies across US states, with high per-capita usage in the West Coast, but also higher usage in Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Missouri, and Virginia. The different tiers reflect a US state\u2019s position within the US distribution of the Anthropic AI Usage Index as defined in this chapter.**Figure 2.6: Claude usage varies across US states, with high per-capita usage in the West Coast, but also higher usage in Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Missouri, and Virginia.**The different tiers reflect a US state\u2019s position within the US distribution of the Anthropic AI Usage Index as defined in this chapter.### Task usage patterns across countriesWe observe notable variation in how Claude is used in different countries. As in past reports, we analyze these trends using two different approaches. First, we classify conversations into tasks according to O*NET, a US taxonomy that maps specific tasks to occupations and occupation groups (e.g., a task involving software debugging would fall into the Computer and Mathematical occupation group).Second, we use Claude to construct a bottom-up taxonomy of user requests on Claude.ai, which provides insight into usage patterns that do not fit neatly into existing taxonomies. For example, the request cluster \u201chelp write and improve cover letters for job applications\u201d (lowest level) feeds into the higher-level cluster \u201chelp with job applications, resumes, and career documents\u201d (middle level), which in turn feeds into the cluster \u201chelp with job applications, resumes, and career advancement\u201d (highest level). These two complementary approaches allow us to both report results aligned with standard labor statistics, and provide flexibility to capture tasks that standard taxonomies miss.#### **Higher per capita Claude usage is associated with more diverse task usage**When analyzing O*NET tasks aggregated at the highest level (in terms of the Standard Occupation Classification occupation groups they belong to), we notice strong variation across countries. While the overall pattern is noisy\u2013especially for countries with fewer observations\u2013Figure 2.7 suggests that as we progress from lower to higher per capita Claude adoption, usage shifts away from tasks in the Computer and Mathematical occupation group (e.g., programming) to more diverse tasks in areas such as education, office and administrative uses, and arts. We also see increased usage in the life, physical and social sciences.!Image 12: Figure 2.7: As we move from lower to higher adoption countries, Claude usage appears to shift away from programming-dominant tasks to a more diverse mix of tasks, though the overall pattern is noisy.This figure shows the relationship between the Anthropic AI Usage Index and the most frequent Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) occupation groups. Each panel shows a different SOC group. SOC share is based on how many O*NET tasks in a given geography fall into a given SOC group. The color indicates which AUI tier a country falls into. The bubble size indicates the usage count for each country. We only include countries with at least 200 observations in our sample for this figure because of the uncertainty of the measure for low-usage countries in our random sample. The regression weights every country equally.**Figure 2.7: As we move from lower to higher adoption countries, Claude usage appears to shift away from programming-dominant tasks to a more diverse mix of tasks, though the overall pattern is noisy.**This figure shows the relationship between the Anthropic AI Usage Index and the most frequent Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) occupation groups.

We only include countries with at least 200 observations in our sample for this figure because of the uncertainty of the measure for low-usage countries in our random sample. The regression weights every country equally.Country idiosyncrasies also emerge when looking at our bottom-up request taxonomy.**8** Take, for example, the United States, Brazil, Vietnam, and India, which represent the country with the highest total usage within a given Anthropic AI Usage Index tier. Users in the United States disproportionately use Claude for household management purposes, to search for jobs, and for medical guidance compared to the global average. By contrast, Claude users in Brazil have comparatively high usage for both translation and legal services. Vietnam\u2019s top disproportionate requests are related to software development and education, and India\u2019s top disproportionate requests focus almost exclusively on software development. This likely reflects local specialization: Brazil has been an early adopter of AI in the judicial system, and India has a large information technology sector.!Image 13: Figure 2.8: Overrepresented request clusters for the United States, Brazil, Vietnam and India. A request is overrepresented in a country when the share of conversations containing that request is higher for that country than globally. For this figure, we focus on request clusters at the middle level of granularity, i.e. more aggregated than the lowest level request clusters, but less aggregated than the highest level request clusters. Only includes requests with at least 1% frequency globally and for that country.**Figure 2.8: Overrepresented request clusters for the United States, Brazil, Vietnam and India.**A request is overrepresented in a country when the share of conversations containing that request is higher for that country than globally. For this figure, we focus on request clusters at the middle level of granularity, i.e. more aggregated than the lowest level request clusters, but less aggregated than the highest level request clusters. Only includes requests with at least 1% frequency globally and for that country.Across all countries, software development emerges as the most common use of Claude. Why do developer tasks consistently lead in overall Claude usage patterns? Several factors likely contribute to this effect:* **Model-task fit:** Claude is a very strong coding model and readily deployed across code generation, debugging, and technical problem-solving tasks.* **Developer receptivity:** Developer communities embrace new tools rapidly, and this usage diffuses through their social and professional networks.* **Low organizational barriers:** Individual developers can typically adopt Claude without complex approval processes\u2014in contrast to, say, medical use cases.### Task usage patterns across the United StatesIn this section we explore patterns of Claude usage across states within the US, giving us further insight into how local economic conditions shape usage patterns. As we discuss above, cross-state differences in the Anthropic AI Usage Index account for less than half of the variation in income differences across US states. This suggests that other regional differences\u2014including the compatibility of Claude capabilities with the occupational composition of the local workforce\u2014play a larger role in determining why usage is more concentrated in some states than others.In a number of states, we see evidence that local patterns of AI use aligns with distinctive features of the local economy. When analyzing the top states in each usage tier\u2014California for leading, Texas for upper middle, Florida for lower middle, and South Carolina for emerging\u2014we see strong variation in terms of our bottom-up request taxonomy (see Figure 2.9).For example, California shows disproportionate use for IT-related requests, digital marketing and translation, likely reflecting its tech sector and linguistically diverse population. California also has disproportionately frequent requests for help with basic numerical tasks, which may represent tests of model capabilities or abuse. Florida sees disproportionate use for business advice and fitness, potentially tied to its role as a financial hub with relatively low tax rates and a warm climate amenable to outdoor activities.!Image 14: Figure 2.9: Overrepresented request categories for California, Texas, Florida and South Carolina. A request is overrepresented in a state when the share of conversations containing that request is higher for that state than in the US as a whole. For this figure, we focus on request clusters at the middle level of granularity, i.e. more aggregated than the lowest level request clusters, but less aggregated than the highest level request clusters. Only includes requests with at least 1% frequency in the United States and for that state.**Figure 2.9: Overrepresented request categories for California, Texas, Florida and South Carolina.**A request is overrepresented in a state when the share of conversations containing that request is higher for that state than in the US as a whole.

Only includes requests with at least 1% frequency in the United States and for that state.Within the US, D.C. leads in terms of per capita Claude usage, with a disproportionate focus on document editing, information provision and job applications across both the O*NET task classification and bottom-up categorization (see Figure 2.10). For example, help with job applications is 1.84x as common in DC as in the US overall. Our interactive dashboard allows everyone to explore the full range of variation and patterns across US states.!Image 15: Figure 2.10: Washington, DC has the highest Claude usage per capita, with disproportionate tasks and requests focusing on document editing, information provision and job applications.

Here, we use the same augmentation and automation collaboration patterns as defined in Chapter 1.Countries have different task mixes, meaning that they focus on different economic tasks, which may partly explain differences in automation patterns. In this section, we investigate whether automated use is systematically different among low and high per capita adoption economies\u2014even when controlling for differences in task mix.**9**We find that even when controlling for the task mix of a country, users from different countries show notably different preferences for autonomous delegation versus collaborative interaction. As Claude usage per capita increases, countries shift from automation-focused to augmentation-focused usage. This is somewhat counter-intuitive, since we are controlling for the more diverse task composition across different countries. We speculate that cultural and economic factors might affect the automation share, or perhaps that early adopters in each country tend to use AI in a more automotive way\u2014but more research is needed here.!Image 16: Figure 2.11: Countries with higher Anthropic AI Usage Index tend to use Claude in a more collaborative manner (augmentation), rather than have it operate independently (automation). This figure shows the relationship between the Anthropic AI Usage Index and the automation share in a given country. We plot the relationship after accounting for a geography\u2019s task mix, thus we show the regression residuals. We only include countries with at least 200 observations in our sample for this figure because of the uncertainty of the measure for low-usage countries in our random sample. Each country is represented by its 3-letter ISO code.**Figure 2.11: Countries with higher Anthropic AI Usage Index tend to use Claude in a more collaborative manner (augmentation), rather than have it operate independently (automation).**This figure shows the relationship between the Anthropic AI Usage Index and the automation share in a given country.

One of the most striking is the geographic concentration of Claude usage. The leadership of the US and California in terms of Claude usage overall, and the strong correlation of Claude usage and income per capita, suggest parallels to past technologies in which initial geographic concentration and specialized use were a key feature. Drawing parallels to the diffusion patterns of prior technologies may help us better understand the diffusion and impact of AI.Surprisingly, geography shapes not just _what_ AI tools are used for, but _how_ they are used. Users in economies with relatively low per capita usage have a relative preference for delegating tasks to Claude (automation), whereas users in economies with high per capita usage are somewhat more likely to prefer more collaborative or learning-based interactions with Claude (augmentation), even when controlling for the task mix. Similar to the local specialization in task use, the local specialization in AI collaboration patterns suggests that impact of AI could be very different in different regions.The geographic patterns of AI adoption\u2014where it is used, for which tasks, and how\u2014suggest that in order to realize the potential of AI to benefit people across the globe, policymakers need to pay attention to local concentration of AI use and adoption, and address the risk of deepening digital divides.1. For privacy reasons, our automated analysis system filters out any cells\u2014e.g., countries, and (country, task) intersections\u2014with fewer than 15 conversations and 5 unique user accounts. For bottom-up request clusters, we have an even higher privacy filter of at least 500 conversations and 250 unique accounts.2. Data in this section covers 1 million Claude.ai Free and Pro conversations from August 4 to 11, 2025, randomly sampled from all conversations in that period that were not flagged as potential trust and safety violations. The unit of observation is a conversation with Claude on Claude.ai, not a user, so it is possible that multiple conversations from the same user are included, though our past work suggests that sampling conversations at random versus stratified by user does not yield substantively different results. Aggregate geographic statistics at the country and US state level were assessed and tabulated from the IP address of each conversation. For geolocation, we use ISO-3166 codes since our provider for IP geolocation uses this standard. International locations use ISO-3166-1 country codes, US state level data use ISO-3166-2 region codes, which include all 50 US states and Washington DC. We exclude conversations originating from VPN, anycast, or hosting services, as determined by our IP geolocation provider.3. International locations use ISO-3166-1 country codes, which includes countries and some territories.4. Tier thresholds (quartiles) are based on countries with at least 200 observations for the global level, and on US states with at least 100 observations for the US level. Countries with no observed usage are assigned to the Minimal tier since we do not know if they have exactly zero usage or little usage that our random sample did not capture. Future work, for example using stratified sampling, will allow us to explore these patterns with higher accuracy given limited observations for smaller countries and states.5. The world map is based on Natural Earth\u2019s world map with the ISO standard point of view for disputed territories, which means that the map may not contain some disputed territories. We note that in addition to the countries shown in gray (\u201cClaude not available\u201d), we do not operate in the Ukrainian regions Crimea, Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia. In accordance with international sanctions and our commitment to supporting Ukraine's territorial integrity, our services are not available in areas under Russian occupation.6. \u201cNo data\u201d applies to countries with partially missing data. Some territories (e.g., Western Sahara, French Guiana) have their own ISO-3611 code. Some of these have some usage, others have none. Since the Anthropic AI Usage Index is calculated per working-age capita based on working age population data from the World Bank, and population data is not readily available for all of these territories, we cannot calculate the AUI for these territories.7. When further investigating Utah\u2019s activity, we discovered a notable fraction of its usage appeared to be possibly associated with coordinated abuse. This is also reflected in a much higher \u201cdirective\u201d automation score than average. However, we ran robustness checks and believe that this activity is not driving the results.8. Requests were filtered to those that represent at least 1% of requests at the global level and 1% of the local level.9. To isolate the relationship between automation preference and Claude usage accounting for task composition differences, we do the following: First, we calculate each country\u2019s expected automation percentage by taking a weighted average. For each O*NET task (e.g., coding, writing, or analysis), we multiply that task's share of the country's usage by the global automation rate for that task type (the percentage of that task that Claude completes via directive/feedback loop patterns globally). Summing these gives us the expected values for each country's automation percentage given the country\u2019s specific task mix. We then regress both the actual automation % and AUI on this expected automation %. The residuals from these regressions represent the variation in each variable that cannot be explained by task composition. By examining the relationship between these residuals (known as partial regression analysis), we can determine whether countries that have higher AI usage than their task mix would predict tend also to have higher-than-predicted automation.Chapter 3: API enterprise deployment of Claude----------------------------------------------### OverviewWhether frontier AI capabilities make us more productive, reshape labor markets, and accelerate growth will depend on when and how firms choose to deploy AI. Even when businesses recognize the potential of AI, profitably adopting it may require costly restructuring of production processes, training new workers, and other sunk-cost investments to facilitate effective deployment.**1**To understand business adoption patterns of AI, we turn to a new data source: Anthropic's first-party (1P) API customers\u2014again relying on privacy-preserving methods.**2** Our API allows customers to integrate Claude directly into their own products and applications, and charges by the token used, rather than a flat subscription fee. This represents a fundamentally different product experience to Claude.ai, which we focused on in the previous two chapters.Institutional inertia, alongside fixed costs of adoption, suggests that early examples of enterprise use of AI is likely to be concentrated among specialized tasks where deployment is easy, capabilities are robust, and the economic benefits from adoption are high.Indeed, we see evidence along these lines in the data presented in this chapter. Our analysis uncovers several patterns:* **Businesses use Claude in similar but more specialized ways than individual users:**Businesses concentrate use in tasks where AI deployment is well suited to programmatic access, like coding or administrative tasks. Compared to Claude.ai users, businesses use Claude less for educational or creative tasks and in more automated ways overall.* **API customers tend to prefer higher cost tasks:**Despite tasks varying dramatically in cost, the most expensive tasks tend to have higher usage, suggesting that model capability, ease of deployment, and economic value of automation determine adoption much more than the cost of the interaction itself. * **Access to appropriate contextual information is needed for sophisticated deployment:**We find evidence of an important potential bottleneck for the usefulness of AI for businesses. API customers that use Claude for complex tasks tend to provide Claude with lengthy inputs. This could represent a barrier to broader enterprise deployment for some important tasks that rely on dispersed context that is not already centralized or digitized. Correcting for this bottleneck may require firms to restructure their organization, invest in new data infrastructure, and centralize information for effective model deployment.### Setting the stage: AI adoption patterns in public dataBefore diving into our API data, it's worth grounding ourselves in the broader landscape of business AI adoption.According to the Census Bureau\u2019s Business Trends and Outlook Survey, AI adoption among US firms has more than doubled in the past two years, rising from 3.7% in fall 2023 to 9.7% in early August 2025 (Figure 3.1).**3** Despite this rapid rate of growth, the vast majority of firms in the US do not report using AI in their production processes.But these aggregate numbers mask large variation across sectors. For example, in early August 2025, one in four businesses in the Information sector reported using AI, which is roughly ten times the rate for Accommodation and Food Services.**4**The picture from this public data is clear: enterprise use of AI is growing rapidly, but we are still in the early stages of AI adoption. Usage remains unevenly distributed across the economy, with the sectors most able to quickly adopt and benefit from this technology doing so.As we will see below, our 1P API data yields a complementary conclusion: early enterprise use of Claude is likewise unevenly distributed across the economy and primarily deployed for tasks typical of Information sector occupations.!Image 17: Figure 3.1: AI adoption rates among US firms, Business Trends & Outlook Survey (Census). Note: AI adoption rates are calculated as the share of firms responding \u201cyes\u201d to the question \u201cIn the last two weeks, did this business use Artificial Intelligence (AI) in producing goods or services? (Examples of AI: machine learning, natural language processing, virtual agents, voice recognition, etc.)\u201d.**Figure 3.1:****AI adoption rates among US firms, Business Trends & Outlook Survey (Census).**Note:AI adoption rates are calculated as the share of firms responding \u201cyes\u201d to the question \u201cIn the last two weeks, did this business use Artificial Intelligence (AI) in producing goods or services? (Examples of AI: machine learning, natural language processing, virtual agents, voice recognition, etc.)\u201d.### Specialized use among Anthropic API customersTo analyze API traffic, we apply the same privacy-preserving classification methods from previous chapters\u2014categorizing anonymized API transcripts by O*NET tasks and into a bottom-up taxonomy. The patterns that emerge show enterprise usage concentrated in specialized tasks particularly suited for automation.Overall, software development dominates the landscape. Among the top 15 use clusters\u2014representing about half of all API traffic\u2014the majority relate to coding and development tasks. Debugging web applications and resolving technical issues each account for roughly 6% of usage, while building professional business software represents another significant chunk. Of note, around 5% of API traffic focuses specifically on developing and evaluating AI systems themselves (Figure 3.2).But not all API usage is for coding. API customers also deploy Claude to create marketing materials (4.7%) and to process business & recruitment data (1.9%). These two categories reveal that AI is being deployed not just for direct production of goods and services but also for talent acquisition and external communications.!Image 18: Figure 3.2: Bottom-Up taxonomy of Claude usage among sampled 1P API transcripts. Using privacy-preserving methods we classified 1P API transcripts into a bottom-up taxonomy reflective of underlying usage. This figure reports the leading use cases at the broadest level of this taxonomy.**Figure 3.2:****Bottom-Up taxonomy of Claude usage among sampled 1P API transcripts.**Using privacy-preserving methods we classified 1P API transcripts into a bottom-up taxonomy reflective of underlying usage. This figure reports the leading use cases at the broadest level of this taxonomy.The O*NET classification makes these patterns even clearer. Little less than half of all API traffic maps to computer and mathematical tasks\u2014more than 8 percentage points higher than Claude.ai usage. Office and administrative tasks come second at roughly 10% of transcripts, reflecting their suitability for automation.On the other hand, several interaction-heavy tasks prominent on Claude.ai have a much smaller share in API usage: education and library tasks drop from 12.3% to 3.6%, while arts and entertainment fall from 8.2% to 5.2%.In many cases however, occupational categories are reasonably close between Claude.ai and API data, suggesting that underlying model capabilities, rather than the specific product surface, drives adoption in many instances.!Image 19: Figure 3.3: Leading Occupational Categories by Overall Usage: Claude.ai vs 1P API. After determining usage shares for tasks, we calculate the share of traffic from Claude.ai and 1P API customers assigned to top-level occupations in the O*NET taxonomy. For example, this figure shows that 44% of API traffic in our sample was matched to a task characteristic of a Computer and Mathematical occupation.**Figure 3.3:****Leading Occupational Categories by Overall Usage: Claude.ai vs 1P API.**After determining usage shares for tasks, we calculate the share of traffic from Claude.ai and 1P API customers assigned to top-level occupations in the O*NET taxonomy. For example, this figure shows that 44% of API traffic in our sample was matched to a task characteristic of a Computer and Mathematical occupation.### Occupational segmentation vs. task specializationDespite serving different users with different interfaces, API and Claude.ai usage follows remarkably similar power law distributions across tasks. Among Claude.ai conversations, the bottom 80% of task categories account for only 12.7% of usage; for API customers it's somewhat more concentrated at 10.5% (Figure 3.4). These extreme concentrations (Gini coefficients**5** of 0.84 and 0.86) reveal massive variation in AI-task fit\u2014the best-matched tasks see orders of magnitude more usage than poorly-matched ones.The similarity across platforms is particularly striking given their different user bases and use cases. Both converge on comparable concentration levels, suggesting a common matching process between AI capabilities and associated economic tasks.Tasks like code generation dominate because they hit a sweet spot where model capabilities excel, deployment barriers are minimal, and employees can adopt the new technology quickly. The long tail of rarely used tasks could reflect several factors.**6** For example, some tasks are simply less common\u2014debugging software happens far more often than negotiating circus contracts. The extreme concentration also suggests the potential role of O-Ring**7** forces: if a task needs a level of reasoning Claude can't handle, internal data the firm can't access, or regulatory approval that doesn't exist, any single barrier could prevent adoption.!Image 20: Figure 3.4: Visualizing concentration of usage among a small number of tasks: Claude.ai versus 1P API. The left panel of this chart calculates Lorenz curves across O*NET tasks for both our Claude.ai and 1P API samples. The highlighted points on the curves indicate how much overall usage the bottom 80% of tasks account for. The right panel plots task rank against task usage share for tasks representing at least 0.1% of overall usage in our samples. Zipf\u2019s law, in which the coefficient of the best-fit-line is equal to -1, occurs with some regularity in various economic settings.**Figure 3.4: Visualizing concentration of usage among a small number of tasks: Claude.ai versus 1P API.**The left panel of this chart calculates Lorenz curves across O*NET tasks for both our Claude.ai and 1P API samples.

Zipf\u2019s law, in which the coefficient of the best-fit-line is equal to -1, occurs with some regularity in various economic settings.### Automation vs. augmentation among API transcriptsThe clearest distinction between API and Claude.ai usage lies in _how_ humans and AI divide the work. When businesses embed Claude into their applications, they largely delegate individual tasks rather than collaborate iteratively with models.In our data, 77% of API transcripts show automation patterns (especially full task delegation) versus just 12% for augmentation (e.g., collaborative refinement and learning). Based on a sample of conversations from Claude.ai, the split between automation and augmentation is nearly even. Looking across economic tasks, the degree of Claude automation through the API is even starker: 97% of tasks show automation-dominant patterns in API usage, compared to only 47% on Claude.ai (Figure 3.6).This makes intuitive sense. Programmatic API access naturally lends itself to automation: businesses provide context, Claude executes the task, and the output flows directly to end users or downstream systems.This pattern echoes how economically consequential technologies become transformative: becoming embedded in systems that let workers access productivity gains without needing specialized skills. While both augmented and automated approaches enhance human capabilities, system-level automation is likely to yield both larger productivity gains across the economy as well as more significant changes in the labor market: Fully automating some tasks, changing which tasks are important for various jobs, and even producing new forms of work altogether.!Image 21: Figure 3.5: Automation versus augmentation collaboration modes across O*NET tasks: Claude.ai versus 1P API. This figure reports the share of Claude.ai conversations and 1P API transcripts that exhibit automation or augmentation patterns of usage for each O*NET task. Automation and augmentation modes are defined in Chapter 1. When for privacy-preserving reasons we do not observe usage shares for a particular collaboration mode we give that category a value of 0% in this figure. Automation dominance is defined as a task having a greater observed share of automation usage. Likewise for augmentation dominance.**Figure 3.5: Automation versus augmentation collaboration modes across O*NET tasks: Claude.ai versus 1P API.**This figure reports the share of Claude.ai conversations and 1P API transcripts that exhibit automation or augmentation patterns of usage for each O*NET task.

Automation dominance is defined as a task having a greater observed share of automation usage. Likewise for augmentation dominance.### The more Claude does, the more Claude needs to knowWhy do our API customers use Claude for some tasks more than others? Beyond fundamental model capabilities, a potentially important explanation is that it is easier to provide Claude with the information needed for successful deployment for some tasks than others.For example, if the goal is to have Claude refactor a module in a complex software development project, Claude may need to read\u2014or at least explore\u2014the entire codebase to understand which changes to make and where. For software development with centralized code repositories, access to this information is in principle straightforward.For other tasks, the appropriate context might not be readily available, or it might be challenging to access. For example, asking Claude to develop a sales strategy for a key account might require Claude having access not only to information contained within a Customer Relationship Management system, but also to tacit knowledge located in the minds of account executives, marketers, and external contacts. All else equal, lacking access to such contextual information will make Claude less capable.We explore this question by looking at the relationship across tasks between the average API input length (i.e., the context given to Claude) and Claude\u2019s average output length (i.e., what the model produces in response).**8**For each O*NET task in our sample, we calculate the average input and output length of associated API transcripts. We then divide these values by the average lengths across all tasks appearing in our sample. This produces an input token index and an output token index for each task. An index value of 1.5, for example, means that the API transcripts associated with that task are 50% longer than the average across tasks.There is considerable variation across tasks in how long Claude\u2019s API outputs are. For example, tasks at the 90th percentile of output length are more than 4x longer than tasks at the 10th percentile. Table 3.1 provides example O*NET tasks, along with a Claude Sonnet 4 summarization of the group of tasks at that part of the distribution.**9** Figure 3.7 shows that output length varies systematically across occupational categories as well.!Image 22: Table 3.1: Example O*NET tasks with shorter and longer output lengths with Claude\u2019s summaries. For each O*NET task matched to 1P API traffic we calculate an output token index: Dividing the average output length across transcripts associated with that task by the average (unweighted) value across all tasks in our sample. Claude was prompted to identify tasks at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile of the output token index distribution with the minimal guidance: \u201cThe columns should be \u2018Example tasks\u2019, \u2018Index Value\u2019, \u2018Summary\u2019 where you provide a summary\u201d. Claude associated output length with task complexity.**Table 3.1: Example O*NET tasks with shorter and longer output lengths with Claude\u2019s summaries.**For each O*NET task matched to 1P API traffic we calculate an output token index: Dividing the average output length across transcripts associated with that task by the average (unweighted) value across all tasks in our sample.

Claude associated output length with task complexity.!Image 23: Figure 3.6: Average output token index across O*NET tasks among leading occupational categories. For each O*NET task matched to 1P API traffic we calculate an output token index: Dividing the average output length across transcripts associated with that task by the average (unweighted) value across all tasks in our sample. We then average across tasks for a given top-level occupational categories in the O*NET taxonomy for top use occupational groups. \u2018All Other\u2019 combines remaining occupational groups into a single category.**Figure 3.6: Average output token index across O*NET tasks among leading occupational categories.**For each O*NET task matched to 1P API traffic we calculate an output token index: Dividing the average output length across transcripts associated with that task by the average (unweighted) value across all tasks in our sample. We then average across tasks for a given top-level occupational categories in the O*NET taxonomy for top use occupational groups. \u2018All Other\u2019 combines remaining occupational groups into a single category.What stands out from Claude\u2019s assessment of tasks is that longer output tasks tend to represent increasingly complex uses. Of course, output length does not capture all dimensions of task complexity, but it appears to be a sensible, easily measured proxy.Because API customers are priced on the margin for both input tokens and output tokens, they have an incentive to optimize model prompting to minimize both input and output tokens when using Claude. In turn, any systematic relationship between input length and output produced by Claude partly captures the underlying contextual constraints in deploying Claude for sophisticated tasks. Stated differently, API customers are incentivized to only provide Claude with just enough context to accomplish their objective and no more. And so we learn about contextual requirements for tasks with varying output length.Looking across tasks, we see a very stable relationship between how much context API customers provide to Claude and how much Claude actually produces. Across economic tasks, each 1% increase in input length is associated with a less-than-proportional 0.38% increase in output length (Figure 3.7). This elasticity of 0.38 suggests that there are strong diminishing marginal returns in translating longer contextual inputs into longer outputs for these economically useful tasks.**10**!Image 24: Figure 3.7: Scatter plot of output token index and input token index across O*NET Tasks. For each O*NET task matched to 1P API traffic we calculate an output token index: Dividing the average output length across transcripts associated with that task by the average (unweighted) value across all tasks in our sample. The input token index is constructed similarly. The elasticity of 0.38 implies that each 1% increase in the input token index is associated with a 0.38% increase in the output token index.**Figure 3.7: Scatter plot of output token index and input token index across O*NET Tasks.**For each O*NET task matched to 1P API traffic we calculate an output token index: Dividing the average output length across transcripts associated with that task by the average (unweighted) value across all tasks in our sample. The input token index is constructed similarly. The elasticity of 0.38 implies that each 1% increase in the input token index is associated with a 0.38% increase in the output token index.The upshot is that deploying AI for complex tasks might be constrained more by access to information than on underlying model capabilities. Companies that can't effectively gather and organize contextual data may struggle with sophisticated AI deployment, creating a potential bottleneck for broader enterprise adoption\u2014particularly for occupations and in industries where tacit, diffuse knowledge is crucial to business operations.### Cost per task and substitution patterns across tasksAPI customers pay per token, creating variation in the cost of deploying Claude for different tasks. More sophisticated tasks will tend to cost more, given their higher input and output token counts. This variation helps us explore whether cost is a major factor in determining which tasks businesses choose to automate with Claude.The data suggests it is not, at least relatively speaking.**11** For example, tasks typical of computer and mathematical occupations cost more than 50% more than sales-related tasks, yet dominate usage.**12** Overall, we find a positive correlation between cost and usage: higher-cost tasks tend to have higher usage rates (Figure 3.9).The positive correlation between cost and usage suggests that cost plays an immaterial role in shaping patterns of enterprise AI deployment. Instead, businesses likely prioritize use in domains where model capabilities are strong and where Claude-powered automation generates enough economic value in excess of the API cost.!Image 25: Figure 3.8: API cost per task and usage share across occupational categories. For each O*NET task matched to 1P API traffic we calculate an API cost index: Dividing the average API cost across transcripts associated with that task by the average (unweighted) value across all tasks in our sample. This figure plots the average API cost index across tasks in a given occupational category against usage share. The estimated elasticity of 3 implies that each 1% increase in the average cost of a task is associated with a 3% increase in prevalence in our sample.**Figure 3.8: API cost per task and usage share across occupational categories.**For each O*NET task matched to 1P API traffic we calculate an API cost index: Dividing the average API cost across transcripts associated with that task by the average (unweighted) value across all tasks in our sample. This figure plots the average API cost index across tasks in a given occupational category against usage share. The estimated elasticity of 3 implies that each 1% increase in the average cost of a task is associated with a 3% increase in prevalence in our sample.While this positive correlation holds overall, we next ask whether demand for Claude capabilities is lower among otherwise similar but costlier tasks. With the important caveat that this should be viewed as a preliminary exploration, this is what we find.Controlling for task characteristics, we find that each 1% cost increase is associated with a 0.29% reduction in usage frequency in our sample of API transcripts (Figure 3.10).**13** While consistent with standard economic theory that higher prices lead to lower demand, the implied increase in usage to a drop in cost is limited. According to this estimate, a 10% cost reduction for a particular task would only increase usage by around 3%.Other factors, beyond the cost of using Claude for particular tasks, appear to matter more for patterns of use.!Image 26: Figure 3.9: Scatter plot of API cost per task and usage share controlling for task characteristics. For each O*NET task matched to 1P API traffic we calculate an API cost index: Dividing the average API cost across transcripts associated with that task by the average (unweighted) value across all tasks in our sample. We then restrict the sample to tasks appearing in both our 1P API and Claude.ai samples. This partial scatter plot controls for the following task-level characteristics: fixed effects for occupational category, collaboration mode share from Claude.ai, and indicators for whether a given collaboration mode was censored for privacy-preserving reasons in the Claude.ai sample. The estimated elasticity of -0.29 implies that each 1% increase in the API cost index for a given task is associated with a 0.29% decrease in prevalence in our sample, after controlling for task characteristics.**Figure 3.9: Scatter plot of API cost per task and usage share controlling for task characteristics.**For each O*NET task matched to 1P API traffic we calculate an API cost index: Dividing the average API cost across transcripts associated with that task by the average (unweighted) value across all tasks in our sample.

Such systematic deployment is likely to be an important conduit by which AI delivers broader productivity gains within the economy. Given clear automation patterns in business deployment, this may also bring disruption in labor markets, potentially displacing those workers whose roles are most likely to face automation.But the implications for the labor market are not entirely clear. As we document above, complex tasks require disproportionately more context. Such information may be scattered across organizations. In such conditions, workers with tacit knowledge about business operations may stand to benefit as complements to sophisticated AI-powered automation.**14** Understanding the uneven labor market implications of AI adoption is an important area for future research.Businesses looking to adopt AI effectively may need to restructure how they organize and maintain the information that frontier systems rely on. Whether today's narrow, automation-heavy adoption evolves toward broader deployment will likely determine AI's future economic impacts.1. In the presence of fixed costs of adjustment, the question businesses face is not necessarily if they will adopt AI, but when. See Hall and Kahn 2003, _Adoption of New Technology_: \u201cThe most important thing to observe about this kind of decision is that at any point in time the choice being made is not a choice between adopting and not adopting but a choice between adopting now or deferring the decision until later.\u201d2. Data in this section covers 1 million transcripts from August 2025, sampled randomly from a pool of 1P API customers constituting roughly half of our 1P API usage. We continue to manage data according to our privacy and retention policies, and our analysis is consistent with our terms, policies, and contractual agreements. Each record is a prompt-response pair from our sample period which in some instances is mid-session for multi-turn interactions.3. Note that this is a different measure of adoption than in the introduction to this report. Reported adoption by consumers and employees of AI reached 40% in 2024 whereas when measured at the firm-level, nine out of ten businesses in the US report not using AI.4. The Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS), published by the Census Bureau, is a reputable barometer of AI adoption by firms in the US. The survey question we use to measure AI adoption is \u201cIn the last two weeks, did this business use Artificial Intelligence (AI) in producing goods or services? (Examples of AI: machine learning, natural language processing, virtual agents, voice recognition, etc.)\u201d. See Crane, Green, and Soto 2025, _Measuring AI Uptake in the Workplace_ for a comparison of BTOS with other measures of overall AI adoption among firms.5. The Gini coefficient is a measure used to quantify inequality within a distribution, such as the distribution of task usage. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 represents perfect equality (every task has exactly the same usage share) and 1 represents perfect inequality (where one task accounts for all usage, and every other task has none).6. Power laws in economic settings are an empirical regularity with notable examples of Zipf\u2019s law in particular. Models that generate this type of outcome feature both underlying heterogeneity and intentional, optimizing decision-making. For more, see Gabaix 2016, _Power Laws in Economics: An Introduction._7. Kremer 1993, _The O-Ring Theory of Economic Development._8. API input length refers to the text in API messages, system prompts, and any additional content sent to the model, including files and datasets relevant to the task at hand. Output length refers to Claude\u2019s generated response to an API call.9. Claude was prompted to identify tasks at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile of the ONET task distribution with the minimal organization of \u201cThe columns should be \u2018Example tasks\u2019, \u2018Index Value\u2019, \u2018Summary\u2019 where you provide a summary\u201d.10. Another contributing factor could be the degradation in performance some models experience at longer context lengths. See Liu et al, 2023, _Lost in the Middle: How Language Models Use Long Contexts._11.The question we ask in this section is whether, all else equal, cost differences across tasks shapes relative usage patterns. This is different from studying whether overall Claude usage is sensitive to external competitive pricing pressures.12. To see that this is the case, we first aggregate O*NET tasks that we identify in our API sample by broad occupational category to measure overall usage shares and the average cost per task in each category. As with the input and output tokens reported by O*NET task, we normalize average cost per task by the average value across tasks observed in our sample.13. Controls include fixed effects for broad occupational categories as well as collaboration mode shares by task from our concurrently sampled Claude.ai conversations. Because some tasks have censored collaboration mode shares, we also include indicators for whether that a particular mode has missing data. We restrict attention to the set of tasks identified in both our API sample and our Claude.ai samples.14. For example, see Ide and Talama\u015b, 2025, _Artificial Intelligence in the Knowledge Economy_.Concluding remarks------------------This third iteration of the Anthropic Economic Index report captures AI adoption at a critical juncture. Existing capabilities of Claude and other frontier AI systems are already poised to transform economic activity, given how broadly applicable the technology is. Rapidly advancing AI capabilities only reinforce the conclusion that immense change is on the horizon.And yet early AI adoption is strikingly uneven. Usage currently clusters in a small set of tasks, with strong geographic variation that is highly correlated with income\u2014particularly across countries. Such concentration reflects where AI capabilities, ease of deployment, and economic value align: coding and data analysis have high usage, while tasks requiring dispersed context or complex regulatory navigation are further behind.Early business adoption of Claude is at once both similar to consumer use (coding is the most common use for both), and different in several consequential ways. In particular, with programmatic access to Claude through the API, businesses tend to use Claude with greater automation. Such systematic enterprise deployment reflects how AI is poised to reshape economic activity: increasing overall productivity, but with uncertain implications for those workers whose existing responsibilities have been automated.These patterns risk creating divergence. If AI's productivity gains concentrate in already-prosperous regions and automation-ready sectors, existing inequalities could widen rather than narrow. If AI automation improves the productivity of workers with tacit organizational knowledge\u2014as some of our evidence suggests\u2014then more experienced workers could see rising demand and higher wages even as entry-level workers face worse labor market prospects.**1**Building on our previous releases, this iteration of the Index\u2019s reports marks a significant expansion in both scope and transparency. We are now open-sourcing comprehensive API usage data alongside our existing Claude.ai consumer data (now including geographic breakdowns at state and country levels), all intersected with detailed task-level classifications.By making this data public, we hope to enable others to investigate questions we haven't considered, test hypotheses about AI's economic impacts, and develop policy responses grounded in empirical evidence.**Ultimately, the economic effects of transformative AI will be shaped as much by technical capabilities as by the policy choices societies make.**History shows that the patterns of technological adoption aren\u2019t fixed: they shift as the technologies mature, as complementary innovations emerge, and as societies make deliberate choices about their deployment. The patterns of highly concentrated use that we observe today may yet evolve towards a broader distribution\u2014one that captures more of AI\u2019s productivity-enhancing potential, accelerates innovation in lagging sectors, and enables new forms of economic value creation. We are still in the early stages of this AI-driven economic transformation. The actions that policymakers, business leaders and the public take now will shape the years to come. We\u2019ll continue tracking these patterns as AI capabilities advance, and provide empirical grounding for navigating one of the most significant economic transitions of our time.1. Brynjolfsson, Chandar, and Chen 2025, _Canaries in the Coal Mine? Six Facts about the RecentEmployment Effects of Artificial Intelligence_ documents clear evidence that entry-level workers with high AI exposure have had relatively worse employment prospects since late 2022. Setting aside questions of causality, the straightforward interpretation is that this is due to AI substituting for work previously done by early-career workers. An alternative interpretation is presented by Gans 2025, _If AI and workers were strong complements, what would we see?_: That relatively faster employment growth for experienced workers reflects AI making such workers more productive and thus in high demand. Whether AI compliments or substitutes work is perhaps the most important question that we hope our data will help answer.Authors and Acknowledgments---------------------------#### **Authors**Ruth Appel*, Peter McCrory*, Alex Tamkin*Miles McCain, Tyler Neylon, Michael Stern_*Lead authors.

Each reflects a major inflection point in AI governance, legal risk, and global application. _(Also see Three Biggest AI Stories in August 2025.)_![Image 14]( Frontier Model AI Safety Bill Advances---------------------------------------------------California\u2019s \u201cFrontier Model\u201d AI safety bill (SB 53) reached its final legislative vote in early September 2025, signaling a push for state-level regulation of advanced, large-scale AI systems. This bill mandates safety disclosures, incident reporting, and whistleblower protections for developers of the most powerful AI models\u2014those expected to impact critical infrastructure and public safety.The bill\u2019s momentum comes amid rising concern over AI-induced risks, from misinformation to economic disruption. After months of amendment (in response to industry lobbying and the Governor\u2019s office), SB 53 now incorporates best practices from both technical experts and public advocates. Politically, California leads the U.S. and potentially the world in formalizing guardrails beyond voluntary industry pledges.This new regulatory blueprint may become the model for other states (and possibly federal legislation). Experts predict mandatory transparency, real-time incident reporting, and structural whistleblower protection could soon become industry norms. Public feedback is mixed: some welcome the accountability, while others warn of regulatory overreach that could stifle innovation. Regardless, the bill\u2019s progress expresses a growing global recognition of the need to balance AI advancement with safety, ethics, and public trust.aimagazine* * *Judge Rejects Anthropic\u2019s $1.5 Billion Copyright Settlement-----------------------------------------------------------On September 8, 2025, a federal judge rejected a landmark $1.5 billion settlement proposal between Anthropic and a group of authors, raising key questions about copyright, fair use, and AI training data. The lawsuit focused on Anthropic\u2019s alleged use of hundreds of thousands of pirated books to train its Claude models.The rejection was based on concerns about fairness and sufficiency\u2014not merely the amount, but the precedents it could set for the entire AI industry. The judge called for new hearings, highlighting the unsettled nature of legal responsibility for the use of copyrighted works in AI training.The decision extends legal uncertainty for leading AI developers and signals intense judicial scrutiny for any future agreements. Publishers, authors, and AI companies must now prepare for stricter standards, likely requiring more transparency, opt-in mechanisms, and perhaps new forms of licensing or compensation. Analysts expect this ruling will slow the pace of AI model development, force more comprehensive settlements, and accelerate global debate about the future of intellectual property in AI.aimagazine* * *Google Expands AI Mode Search to Multiple New Languages-------------------------------------------------------On September 8, 2025, Google announced that its AI-powered search \u201cAI Mode\u201d now supports five new languages: Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, and Brazilian Portuguese. This expansion\u2014beyond months of English-only service\u2014brings powerful conversational and search capabilities to tens of millions of new users across Asia and Latin America.The move signals Google\u2019s commitment to global accessibility, as well as the intensifying race between U.S. and Chinese tech giants to dominate multilingual AI. The technical challenge lies in ensuring high-quality, culturally nuanced responses for languages with fewer resources or unique social contexts.Early reactions highlight both the promise and risks of globalizing generative AI. While broader access is widely welcomed and expected to fuel innovation and education, critics emphasize the urgency of addressing biases and maintaining accuracy\u2014particularly in low-resource languages and contexts where AI-driven search may not yet be fully robust. Google now faces the ongoing dual challenge of scaling up while monitoring for quality and fairness at unprecedented scale.aimagazine* * *References (APA Style)----------------------* The AI Track.

Here\u2019s what went down 25 years ago that ultimately burst the dot-com boomBy Dave SmithBy Dave SmithEditor, U.S. NewsDave SmithEditor, U.S. NewsDave Smith is a writer and editor who previously has been published in Business Insider, Newsweek, ABC News, and USA TODAY.SEE FULL BIOSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI Inc., during a media tour of the Stargate AI data center in Abilene, Texas, US, on Tuesday, Sept. 23, 2025.Kyle Grillot / Bloomberg\u2014Getty ImagesThe comparison between today\u2019s artificial intelligence frenzy and the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s has become impossible to ignore. As AI companies command valuations reaching into the hundreds of billions\u2014minting dozens of new billionaires in 2025 alone\u2014and tech giants pour unprecedented sums into data centers, investors and analysts are asking a similar question: Are we watching history repeat itself?The similarities are striking. Like the internet companies of two decades ago, AI firms today attract massive investments based on transformative potential rather than current profitability. Global corporate AI investment reached $252.3 billion in 2024, according to research from Stanford University, with the sector growing thirteenfold since 2014. Meanwhile, America\u2019s biggest tech companies\u2014Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft\u2014have pledged to spend a record $320 billion on capital expenditures this year alone, much of it for AI infrastructure.Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, whose company is valued at approximately $500 billion despite launching ChatGPT just two years ago, acknowledges the parallels. \u201cAre we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes,\u201d Altman said in August. \u201cIs AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.\u201dBut what actually caused the dot-com bubble to burst in March 2000, and what lessons does it offer for today\u2019s AI boom? Let\u2019s take a stroll down memory lane\u2014or, if you weren\u2019t born yet, some plain ole history.### The perfect storm of 2000The dot-com crash wasn\u2019t triggered by a single event, but rather a convergence of factors that exposed fundamental weaknesses in the late 1990s tech economy. The first critical blow came from the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates multiple times throughout 1999 and 2000. The federal funds rate climbed from around 4.7% in early 1999 to 6.5% by May 2000, making speculative investments less attractive as investors could earn higher returns from safer bonds.The second catalyst was a broader economic recession that began in Japan in March 2000, triggering global market fears and accelerating the flight from risky assets. This one-two punch of higher rates and global uncertainty caused investors to reassess the astronomical valuations of internet companies.But the underlying problem ran much deeper: Most dot-com companies had fundamentally flawed business models. Commerce One reached a $21 billion valuation despite minimal revenue. TheGlobe.com, founded by two Cornell students with $15,000 in startup capital, saw its stock price jump 606% on its first day of trading to $63.50, despite having no revenue beyond venture funding. Pets.com burned through $300 million in just 268 days before declaring bankruptcy.### Infrastructure overbuildPerhaps the most instructive parallel for today\u2019s AI boom lies in the massive infrastructure overinvestment that preceded the dot-com crash. Telecommunications companies laid more than 80 million miles of fiber optic cables across the U.S., driven by WorldCom\u2019s wildly inflated claim that internet traffic was doubling every 100 days\u2014far beyond the actual annual doubling rate.Companies like Global Crossing, Level 3, and Qwest raced to build massive networks to capture anticipated demand that never materialized. The result was catastrophic overcapacity. Even four years after the bubble burst, 85% to 95% of the fiber laid in the 1990s remained unused, earning the nickname \u201cdark fiber.\u201dCorning, the world\u2019s largest optical-fiber producer, saw its stock crash from nearly $100 in 2000 to about $1 by 2002. Ciena\u2019s revenue fell from $1.6 billion to $300 million almost overnight, with its stock plunging 98% from its peak.The parallels to today\u2019s AI infrastructure buildout are unmistakable. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced plans this year for an AI data center \u201cso large it could cover a significant part of Manhattan\u201d. The Stargate Project, backed by OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and MGX, aims to develop a $500 billion nationwide network of AI data centers.Yet, crucial differences exist. Unlike many dot-com companies that had no revenue, major AI players are generating substantial income. Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud service, heavily focused on AI, grew 39% year-over-year to an $86 billion run rate. OpenAI projects $20 billion in annualized revenue by the end of the year, according to *The Information*, up from around $6 billion at the start of the year.### The big reality checkThe dot-com crash ultimately came down to a harsh reality: Most internet companies couldn\u2019t justify their valuations with actual business results. Companies were valued based on website traffic and growth metrics rather than traditional measures like cash flow and profitability.Today\u2019s AI companies face a similar test. While AI investment has reached historic levels, the revenue gap remains substantial. According to tech writer Ed Zitron, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, Amazon, and Google will have invested about $560 billion in AI infrastructure over the last two years, but have brought in just $35 billion in AI-related revenue combined.A recent MIT study found that 95% of AI pilot projects fail to yield meaningful results, despite more than $40 billion in generative AI investment. This disconnect between investment and returns echoes the fundamental problem that ultimately doomed the dot-com bubble.The question facing investors today isn\u2019t whether AI will transform the economy\u2014most experts agree it will. The question is whether current valuations and infrastructure investments can be justified by near-term returns, or whether, like the fiber-optic cables of the 1990s, much of today\u2019s AI infrastructure will sit unused while the market awaits demand to catch up with supply. As history shows, even transformative technologies can\u2019t escape the gravitational pull of economics\u2014so while the internet did change the world, it didn\u2019t happen as quickly as some of its early champions promised, and several of those people who got ahead of themselves were humbled in the process.*For this story,*Fortune*used generative AI to help with an initial draft.

But research from the Economic Innovation Group shows that from 2022 to the beginning of 2025, the unemployment rate rose less for the most AI exposed workers (up 0.30 percentage points) than for the least AI-exposed workers (up 0.94 points).### Impact of Technology on WorkersBusinesses most often reported their \u201cnumber of workers did not change overall\u201d between 2020 and 2022 after adopting any of the five technologies the ABS tracked: AI, specialized software, robotics, cloud-based tech or specialized equipment (Figure 1).When these technologies did have an impact, all (except robotics) were reportedly more likely to increase than decrease worker numbers.There was no statistically significant difference between the number of workers increased (9.5%) or decreased (8.1%) by robotics.When compared, none of the technologies significantly increased worker numbers more than any other.![Image 7: Figure 1. Impact of Technology on the Number of Workers: 2022]( Impact of Technology on Worker SkillsMost businesses also reported these technologies had little or no impact on worker skill level (Figure 2).AI was the technology businesses most often cited as positively affecting the skill level of workers (Figure 2).Only 3.9% of businesses using robotics and 3.3% of businesses using AI reported workers\u2019 skill level decreased \u2014 the largest shares in this category (with no statistically significant difference between them).![Image 8: Figure 2. Impact of Technology on the Skill Level of Workers: 2022]( (40.7%), specialized equipment (50.2%) and robotics (56.6%) largely had no overall impact on worker\u2019s scientific, technological, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) skills (Figure 3).When a technology _did_ alter skills of STEM workers, it was more likely to boost than diminish them \u2014 with robotics (20.7%) and AI (22.1%) the most likely.Cloud-based technology and specialized software were most often found \u201cnot applicable\u201d to STEM worker skills (40.9% and 41.6%, respectively) or to have caused no change overall (44.4% and 44.9%, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences between these two impact categories and technologies.![Image 9: Figure 3. How Technology Impacts Worker's STEM Skills: 2022 ]( Why Companies Embrace New TechnologiesImproving the quality or reliability of processes or methods was the most common motivating factor for businesses to adopt cloud-based technology (51.8%), specialized software (49.8%) and AI (45.8%) between 2020 and 2022 (Figure 4).Specialized equipment and robotics were the only categories in which improving processes or methods was not the top motivating factor.The top reason cited for adopting specialized equipment was to improve the quality or reliability of goods or services (49.8%).Businesses used robotics to automate tasks performed by human labor (50.8%), improve the quality or reliability of goods and services (41.8%), and improve the quality or reliability of processes or methods (43.6%). The differences between these motivations were not statistically significant.![Image 10: Figure 4. Why Companies Adopt Technology: 2022 ]( When Technology was AdoptedBusinesses used AI at a higher rate (68.0%) than other technologies from 2021 to 2022.But they adopted other surveyed technologies at a higher rate from 2016 to 2020:* Cloud-based (40.0%).* Specialized software (27.0%).* Specialized equipment (23.6%).Adoption of robotics technology remained relatively steady, ranging from 23.6% to 26.9% between 2016 and 2022 (with no significant difference between these shares).### The Importance and Impact of TechnologyMost businesses reported cloud-based technology (59.0%), specialized software (58.9%), and specialized equipment (57.4%) were \u201cvery important\u201d to their processes or methods (Figure 5).In contrast, they said robotics (47.1%) and AI (58.0%) were only \u201csomewhat important.\u201dOverall, respondents pointed to cloud-based and specialized software as the two most important technologies for improving business processes and methods.![Image 11: Figure 5.

New **Prevent Blindness data** shows that there were 43,379 sports-related eye injuries treated in the United States in 2024, an increase of 33 percent from the previous year.The new data also shows that basketball had the highest rate of eye injuries. Rounding out the top five sports eye injury categories are projectile/flying toys, soccer, pool and water sports, and exercise/exercise equipment.To help educate the public on the importance of wearing proper eye protection while playing sports, Prevent Blindness offers free sports eye safety information including a dedicated **webpage**, fact sheet, and shareable **social media graphics**. The Prevent Blindness Focus on Eye Health Expert Series episode, \u201c**Sports Eye Safety,**\u201d with sports vision specialist **Keith Smithson, OD**, of Northern Virginia Doctors of Optometry, and Sports Vision Pros, is also available.According to the **American Academy of Ophthalmology**, common sports-related eye injuries include:* Corneal abrasions, or scratches on the surface of the eye* Bruises on eyelids or skin around the eye* Retinal detachments, which can lead to permanent vision loss if not treated promptly* Traumatic cataracts* Subconjunctival hemorrhage, or blood spots appearing on the eye* Internal bleeding* Fractures to the bone around the eye* Damage to the optic nerve or glaucoma* Open globe injuries, which can lead to permanent vision loss**Prevent Blindness recommends** that athletes wear eye guards when participating in sports. Prescription glasses, sunglasses and even occupational safety glasses do not provide adequate protection.Sports eye guards are protective eye wear that could look like glasses with temples or straps or even shields attached to head gear. Eye guards come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Eye guards should fit securely and comfortably and allow the use of a helmet if necessary.For sports use, polycarbonate lenses must be used with protectors that meet or exceed the requirements of the current sport-specific ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) International, a global standards development organization. Polycarbonate lenses are the most impact resistant. They are thinner and lighter than plastic, shatterproof, and provide UV protection. Most sports have a specific ASTM standard which addresses the specific risks likely to be encountered in that sport.\u201cFortunately, most eye injuries can be avoided by wearing the proper eye protection, including while playing sports,\u201d said Jeff Todd, president and CEO at Prevent Blindness. \u201cBy taking the proper precautions and consistently wearing sports protection recommended by an eye care professional, we can keep our vision and eyes healthy today and for some years to come.\u201d[Reset](#)Sports Eye Safety Month 2025Download[x](#)### Can we help you find something?Trending TopicsFinancial AssistanceEye InflammationVision ScreeningObservance Calendarpowered by AI* [Your Sight](#) + The Eye & How We See + A Glossary of Eye and Vision Terms + What\u2019s Your Risk of a Vision Problem? + Signs of Eye Disease and Vision Problems in Adults + Find an Eye Doctor + Getting Professional Eye Care -
