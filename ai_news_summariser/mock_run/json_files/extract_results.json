One of them\u2014the rift between the so-called \u201ctech right\u201d and the Republican Party\u2019s traditional social conservative base\u2014has widened into a gaping chasm under the pressure of artificial intelligence.The chasm was on full display earlier this month as parallel dramas played out at the White House and the Westin Downtown DC just a few blocks away. At the Rose Garden, two dozen tech leaders, representing the richest companies in history, gathered for a private dinner with the president, seeking to outdo one another in flattery. \u201cThank you for being such a pro-business, pro-innovation president. It\u2019s a very refreshing change,\u201d gushed Sam Altman of OpenAI, a sentiment echoed by his rivals at Apple and Google. Seated immediately next to President Trump was Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, until recently a pariah on the right.Just down the street at the Westin earlier that day, however, Sen. Josh Hawley (who had recently announced a Senate investigation into Meta for sexually grooming children) threw down the gauntlet against the AI companies in his speech at the annual National Conservatism Conference. Warning of the religious zealotry and elite arrogance of Silicon Valley\u2019s transhumanist quest, he declared, \u201cAmerica is a nation founded on the idea of the common man. The American republic is premised on his worth and his liberty. But the transhumanist ideal rejects the common man\u2019s worth. And artificial intelligence threatens the common man\u2019s liberty.\u201dHawley was far from the only speaker to denounce transhumanism at the conference, which increasingly serves to define the Overton window for the Right in the age of Trump. Indeed, conference organizer Rachel Bovard announced in NatCon\u2019s opening speech that \u201cConservatism is about human dignity and human flourishing. By definition, there is no such thing as a transhuman conservatism.\u201d But Hawley\u2019s systematic vivisection of the way the ideology is fueling the AI craze stood out as a high point in the conference. \u201cThe problem with the AI \u2018revolution\u2019 as it\u2019s currently going,\u201d he warned, \u201cis that it only entrenches the power of the people who are already the most powerful in the world.\u201dAI seemed to be on everyone\u2019s minds. Steve Bannon denounced it from the mainstage. Two breakout sessions were explicitly dedicated to it. At one of them, Geoffrey Miller, a psychology professor at the University of New Mexico, called AI developers \u201cbetrayers of our species, traitors to our nation, apostates to our faith, and threats to our kids.\u201d At another, \u201cTech and the Future of the Family,\u201d featuring two prominent child online safety advocates, Michael Toscano and Clare Morell, and two AI experts, Tim Estes and Dean Ball, perspectives were a bit more nuanced, but the overall note was still wary. Ball, lead author of the White House\u2019s AI Action Plan, cautioned that \u201cthe bright future I envision is fragile. A tiny error could send us down a deeply wrong path,\u201d while Estes, founder of AngelQ AI, asserted that \u201ctrue conservatism, in this new age, requires us to stand and defend the human person against this unprecedented threat\u201d posed by the business model of the AI companies.But there are important distinctions here. One may denounce a business model, as Estes did, and an ideology, as Hawley did, without denouncing a technology as such. It is a tired and unhelpful clich\u00e9 to say that \u201cAI is just a tool,\u201d but what we can say is that it is a technology we still (for now) have power to steer. And it is the task of politics to determine which way we want to steer it, and to display the iron will to hold that course. As Toscano outlined the dynamic, drawing on Karl Polanyi\u2019s 1944 masterpiece, *The Great Transformation*, we are witnessing today a \u201cdouble movement\u201d of economic forces seeking to instrumentalize humanity and of social forces mobilizing spontaneously in defense of the family and the human person.\u201cThe Trump administration,\u201d he said, \u201cmust take action to incorporate into itself both sides of the double movement \u2026 and then must establish within the government vehicles for dialog where the two sides can productively interact and negotiate.\u201dAlthough the president\u2019s Rose Garden dinner guest list may have made that look unlikely, a gathering of the White House\u2019s AI in Education Task Force earlier that same day gave glimmers of hope. The presiding first lady, who this spring championed the *TAKEITDOWN Act* against the epidemic of AI deepfake pornography, spoke to the gathered tech executives in optimistic but guarded tones: \u201cas leaders and parents, we must manage AI\u2019s growth responsibly. During this primitive stage, it is our duty to treat AI as we would our own children\u2014empowering but with watchful guidance.\u201d Not quite right, perhaps\u2014we must put the interests of our children far above those of AI, and recognize the threat that AI poses to them\u2014but an important warning nonetheless. Conservatives will be closely watching the administration\u2019s next moves for signs of a commitment to secure our human future in an age of AI.If you enjoyed this article and would like to support WORLD's brand of Biblically sound journalism, click here.![Littlejohn 2025 06 06 222318 vekx](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%27 (Ph.D., University of Edinburgh) is director of programs and education at American Compass.

                "raw_content": "[Newswire](/newswire-announcements) | [SUBSCRIBE](/subscribe/)# Reflexive AI: When Gen AI Becomes a New Business DefaultByPYMNTS | September 28, 2025|To use AI reflexively is to reach for it automatically, without hesitation. It becomes the instinctive first step rather than a conscious decision. It is when workers stop asking \u201cshould I use AI here?\u201d and instead treat it as naturally as email or search. That shift from curiosity to obligatory is unfolding across industries.## **From Curiosity to Obligatory**A few years ago, AI adoption was a curiosity project. Innovation labs ran pilots, and early adopters tinkered. Today, not using AI risks falling behind. The Wall Street Journal has reported that corporate org charts are being redrawn to account for embedded AI roles and responsibilities, a sign that AI is moving from side project to structural core. Reuters has documented how banks including J.P. Morgan are deploying AI to boost sales, manage clients and even assign chatbots as \u201cresearch analysts\u201d to staff. Bloomberg recently detailed how firms are quietly weaving AI into daily Wall Street routines, treating it as operational plumbing rather than a moonshot.Payments firms are reaching the same inflection point. A PYMNTS Intelligence survey found that 98% of U.S. product leaders believe generative AI will reshape operations within three years. Mastercard has rolled out conversational AI for payments, embedding it directly into transactions rather than treating it as an external add-on. Swift is experimenting with AI to catch cross-border fraud in real time, making it part of the network\u2019s reflexive defense system. These are not experiments at the edges. They are examples of AI being woven in until it disappears into the workflow.## **Embedded and Invisible**The hallmark of reflexive AI use is that it no longer feels like a decision. A developer leans on GitHub Copilot and finishes a project 55 percent faster. A payments ops analyst automatically runs anomalies through a model before flagging them manually. A banker defaults to an AI assistant to scan client data before drafting recommendations.The Wall Street Journal recently described how employees are now reflexively using AI to compress research and discovery time, often without realizing it is a shift in process. Deloitte has gone further, warning that boards should treat AI fluency as a leadership requirement, not a technical skill set.Payments show how invisible this can become. PYMNTS reported that large transaction models (LTMs) are now securing payment flows in the background, constantly scanning patterns without requiring users to think about them. In that sense, AI does not feel like a discrete step. It feels like part of the infrastructure.Advertisement: Scroll to Continue## **The New Default**Reflexive AI use changes the burden of proof. Instead of teams asking leaders for permission to try AI, leaders now ask why AI was not used first. In banks, this shows up in research tasks. In payments, it shows up in fraud detection and customer service. In tech, it shows up in code and content. The reflex is spreading across industries.Of course, risks remain. Reflexive adoption without governance can amplify bias or hallucinations. Mandates in compliance-heavy organizations can backfire. But the organizations moving fastest are those where curiosity is rewarded, prompt failures are shared, and AI use is safe to experiment with.Every era of work has had its new default. Email replaced fax. Cloud replaced on-premise. Remote replaced office-first. Now deliberate AI adoption is yielding to reflexive AI. The companies that gain the most will be those where employees use AI naturally, without needing to think about it.#### RecommendedReflexive AI: When Gen AI Becomes a New Business DefaultOpenAI CEO Meets With UAE to Promote AI AmbitionsDrive-Thru Coffee Purchases Hit Record 59%Walmart CEO Foresees AI Transforming 'Literally Every Job'See More In: AI, artificial intelligence, gen AI, large transaction models, News, PYMNTS Intelligence, PYMNTS News, reflexive AI# OpenAI CEO Meets With UAE to Promote AI AmbitionsByPYMNTS | September 28, 2025|OpenAI\u2019s CEO has reportedly met with the UAE\u2019s president to discuss the country\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions.That\u2019s according to a report Saturday (Sept. 27) from Reuters, citing the United Arab Emirates (UAE) state news agency.According to the report, the talks between Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman focused on boosting cooperation between OpenAI and its counterparts in the UAE, especially in the field of AI research and its practical applications.\u201cThis cooperation aligns with the UAE\u2019s ambition to establish an integrated AI ecosystem, supporting the country\u2019s development plans and its drive to build a knowledge-based economy,\u201d the agency said.Reuters noted that the UAE, a major oil producer, is developing one of the largest AI data centers in the world, as well as a new Arabic-language AI model.In addition, the UAE has been working to use its strong relationship with the U.S. to gain access to AI technology. The two countries signed an agreement in May that will see the UAE construct one of the biggest AI campuses outside the U.S. in a deal was announced during President Donald Trump\u2019s trip to Abu Dhabi.Advertisement: Scroll to ContinueAs PYMNTS wrote earlier this year, both the UAE and Saudi Arabia are racing to build data centers at scale as the countries compete for AI supremacy in the Middle East.\u201cAs of early 2025, Saudi Arabia had existing data center capacity of more than 300 megawatts, which is competitive with UAE\u2019s capacity of more than 250 megawatts, according to ResearchAndMarkets.com,\u201d the report said.\u201cBut when it comes to future projects, Saudi Arabia blows away the UAE: It has upcoming capacity of 2,200 megawatts while the UAE is expecting about 500 megawatts.\u201dMeanwhile, data from the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) shows that AI preparedness in the region can vary by quite a lot. Israel is in first place here, followed by UAE and Saudi Arabia. Aside from Qatar, Oman and Bahrain, the remaining countries \u201cdrop off considerably in the rankings,\u201d PYMNTS wrote.In other AI news, PYMNTS wrote last week about the launch of the latest version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, and how it fits in with Altman\u2019s vision of developing infrastructure that makes intelligence \u201cabundant.\u201d\u201cThat ambition is being matched by industrial-scale investment, including Nvidia\u2019s planned $100 billion commitment to expand OpenAI\u2019s compute capacity, a deal that cements both companies as central players in generative AI,\u201d the report added.#### RecommendedOpenAI CEO Meets With UAE to Promote AI AmbitionsDrive-Thru Coffee Purchases Hit Record 59%Walmart CEO Foresees AI Transforming 'Literally Every Job'American Consumers Facing Highest Tariff Rate in 90 YearsSee More In: AI, data centers, News, OpenAI, PYMNTS News, Sam Altman, United Arab Emirates, What's Hot#### Trending NewsReflexive AI: When Gen AI Becomes a New Business DefaultOpenAI CEO Meets With UAE to Promote AI AmbitionsDrive-Thru Coffee Purchases Hit Record 59%#### The Big StoryBailouts: The Emergency Button That Keeps Getting Reinstalled#### Featured NewsCloud-Native Payments Let Banks Treat Data Like Rocket FuelHow Data Catches Silent Churn Before Cardholders Walk AwayCircle Sinks 11% as Stablecoin Refund Debate Rattles Markets65% of SMBs Are Ready to Switch Software for Embedded FinancePrime Time Showdown: Amazon and Walmart Face Off in OctoberMedicare Tests Algorithms to Streamline Prior AuthorizationData Beats Instinct in the Race to Outrun Fraudsters#### SubscribeNo JW Player availablePlease embed a JW Player into your page in order to use Channel Embeds.Waiting for live event to start...#### Partner with PYMNTSWe\u2019re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.[Learn More](/partnerships/)"

If your job involves repetitive or automated tasks the impact could be significant.Research has suggested nearly a million jobs in London could be changed by AI, affecting more than 200,000 telemarketers, 150,000 bookkeepers and more than 95,000 data entry specialists.The research from online CV company LiveCareer UK, indicated other jobs at risk include fast food and warehouse workers, retail cashiers, paralegals and proof readers.Consultancy firm McKinsey agreed, and said the number of adverts for jobs vulnerable to AI's impact is down 38% compared to three years ago.Women were identified as being at a higher risk than men because they occupy more of the roles AI could impact.Jasmine Escalera, an expert at LiveCareer, said companies should take this into account and avoid \"inadvertently using AI\" to create increased gender disparity.She said it was important to engage with the idea and consider how AI has started to change roles already, and how might it change moving forward.\"Have an open conversation with your manager on what you can do to complement the change,\" she advised.One NHS Trust has started using AI as a tool to help staff, not to replace them.Medication at Queen Elizabeth Hospital's pharmacy is dispensed by a robot and administered by clinicians.AI then uses data to build a pattern of how much medicine is needed to ensure the smooth-running of the hospital.For example, when it's winter flu season, the respiratory ward needs to have enough nebulisers.Rachel Knight, the chief pharmacist at Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust said they were dispensing about 400,000 items a year.\"Understanding the intricate detail of what we're dispensing, to who and where it needs to be is really challenging\".Pharmacists could not manually identify any patterns, but AI can.\"It can tell us where we need to store our medicines so they're ready for the patient at the point of use. It makes our whole work flow more efficient and it also makes it a lot safer for the patients,\" she said.The government made AI a key part of their 10-year strategy for the NHS.It would involve showing staff about what it can do and how it can do it.Ms Knight, as well as a pharmacist, is also on a digital apprenticeship scheme to teach staff AI skills.\"I knew that it was going to be really pivotal over the next 5, 10, 15 years and I didn't feel that in my role as a leader, I was able to lead my team effectively through that.\"Zeinab Hussain is the digital health leader at Lewisham and Greenwich Trust.She said AI was not there to take jobs but to take over some of those \"mundane repetitive tasks\".She added: \"If it can help us to detect risks sooner, then really that's just going to help us with better outcomes in the long term.\"There's plenty of work to do in the NHS, so there's absolutely no concern around us losing staff, but actually it's about upskilling them to do different roles within the organisation.\"## Fewer job advertsWhat about other industries?Much has been written about the City's adoption of AI and the impact on entry-level white-collar jobs.Research from McKinsey suggested more than a third of midsize (250 employees or more) businesses across the country said they were now using AI.They said the overall number of jobs advertised had fallen by 31% between May and July compared with the same period three years ago.In occupations with high exposure to AI, the adverts dropped by 38%.Researchers said if entry-level hiring continued to slow, organisations risked leaving gaps in their future workforce.They advised businesses to rethink how they use AI and identify \"which tasks are best automated and which need human creativity, judgement and relationships.\"Today's entry-level hires will shape tomorrow's AI strategies, culture, and competitiveness.\"## 'Half of workers'We can expect to see \"efficiencies\".Amazon, JP Morgan, Microsoft and Ford are among the companies who are predicting AI will affect jobs.Chief executive of Ford, Jim Farley, predicted AI would \"replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S\".One sector leading the way with the adoption of AI is tech.Over the summer Snap, the company behind the social media platform Snapchat, ran a summer workshop in partnership with the Royal College of Art to help young people experiment with augmented reality and design a landscape, using AI to build it.Speaking from the workshop, Arron, a first-year in graphic design at Central St Martins, said designers \"need to learn AI as a tool to help us, not replace us.\"I think in the future there should be more regulations as to how it's used.\"Snap has been using AI to develop augmented reality glasses that interact with the world.Director of computer vision engineering, Qi Pan, disagreed with the idea that AI would displace jobs in his sector but would instead help people be more efficient in what they do.\"Our developers take a creative idea that's in their head and try to turn it into reality. And AI really helps us to do that in much faster ways.\"I think what we'll see is that we'll see just an exponential increase in the amount of productivity rather than jobs being taken away.\"*Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on* *Sounds* *and follow BBC London on* *Facebook**,* *X* *and* *Instagram**.

We keep clickingPresident Donald Trump and his administration have embraced artificial intelligence-generated images, crafting a new official portrait of him![]( -- Here he is, depicted at six months in office, chiseled and brawny, as mighty as the very nation. Here he is as a Star Wars Jedi wielding a patriot-red lightsaber, rescuing our galaxy from the forces of evil. Here he is taking over Gaza, transforming the strip into a luxury resort complete with a golden effigy of himself.You can be anything, perhaps you were told growing up. Doctor. Astronaut. Maybe, one day, the president. But even the chief executive of the United States, the free world\u2019s leader, frames himself as something more epic \u2014 as someone not entirely himself.On the social media accounts of Donald Trump and his second-term administration, a new official image of the president is emerging bit by bit: one generated artificially.A sign of the times, certainly \u2014 when the appeal of reimagining yourself with artificial intelligence has trickled up from us everyday citizens. Bored with your selfies? Join a viral trend: There\u2019s an image generator or a chatbot that can turn you into a Renaissance-style painting, a Studio Ghibli character or an action figure with box art and accessories.Artificial imagery isn\u2019t new for Trump, an early target of AI-generated simulacra who later exploited the technology during his 2024 campaign for the presidency. \u201cIt works both ways,\u201d the Republican president said of AI-generated content at a news conference earlier this month. \u201cIf something happens that\u2019s really bad, maybe I\u2019ll have to just blame AI.\u201dThe AI images of Trump posted by him and his team opt for the alternative \u2014 not deceptive but self-evident in their fictitiousness. Pope Francis dies, and Trump jokes to reporters that he\u2019d like to be pope. A week later, he is, but in an AI-generated image that he posts, reposted by the White House. Trump likens himself to a king in a Truth Social post in February, and AI makes him one in an X post by the White House less than an hour later.The artifice arrives in Trump\u2019s usual style \u2014 brassy, unabashed, attention-grabbing \u2014 and squares with his social media team\u2019s heavy meme posting, which it has promised to continue. The administration\u2019s official social media accounts have grown by more than 16 million new followers across platforms since Inauguration Day, a White House official told NBC News.The White House recognizes the appeal. In July, it posted to its X account: \u201cNowhere in the Constitution does it say we can\u2019t post banger memes.\u201d Attached to the post, a photo of a sign on the White House lawn parodying the naysayers: \u201coMg, diD tHe wHiTE hOuSE reALLy PosT tHis?\u201dBehind the commander in chief\u2019s desire to craft an AI self \u2014 not itself uncommon \u2014 an infantry of official communications channels stands at his ready. And we, the people, can\u2019t help but tune in.Like so much on the internet these days, Trump\u2019s AI portraits are primed for people to react, says Evan Cornog, a political historian and author of \u201cThe Power and the Story: How the Crafted Presidential Narrative Has Determined Political Success from George Washington to George W. Bush.\u201d\u201cBy the time you\u2019ve seen it, you\u2019ve understood it. And that\u2019s, of course, the efficacy,\u201d Cornog said. \u201cIt requires no effort, either for the person generating it, but particularly for the person consuming it.\u201dThe expressive power of political imagery, regardless of the truth of its message, has long been understood by politicians and their detractors.President William Henry Harrison\u2019s log cabin and hard cider campaign symbols, representing him as a \u201cman of the people,\u201d helped him win the election of 1840. Thirty years later, political cartoonist Thomas Nast would turn public opinion against William Marcy \u201cBoss\u201d Tweed with his scathing portrayals of the politician, whom he depicted satirically overweight from greed. \u201cLet\u2019s stop those damned pictures!\u201d Tweed once said, or so the story goes.The decades since witnessed the birth of photo, film, TV, the internet, computer printers, image-editing software and digital screens that shrank until they could fit in our pockets, making it increasingly easy to create and disseminate \u2014 and manipulate \u2014 imagery.By contrast, today\u2019s generative AI technology offers greater realism, functionality and accessibility to content creation than ever before, says AI expert Henry Ajder. Not to mention, of course, a capacity for endless automated possibility.Past presidents \u201chad to actually have fought in a war to run as a war hero,\u201d Cornog says. Now, they can just generate an image of themselves as one. On a horse \u2014 or no, a battlefield. With an American flag waving behind him and an eagle soaring.## Popular Reads![]( Trump admin live updates: Gov. says 'no need' after Trump directs troops to Portland![]( 4 dead, 8 injured in Michigan church shooting and fire set by gunman: Police![]( Sniper opens fire on Dallas ICE facility, killing 1 detainee, wounding 2: DHSThe AI images of Trump shared by him and his administration chase a similarly heroic vision of the president. Potency \u2014 his and the country\u2019s \u2014 is a consistent theme, Cornog added.Indeed, generative AI allows for an exposure of perhaps uncomfortably intimate inner worlds as people use such technology to illustrate and communicate their \u201cfantasy lives\u201d or cartoonish versions of themselves, says Mitchell Stephens, author of \u201cThe Rise of the Image, the Fall of the Word.\u201dBut it can just as easily fulfill an inverse desire: to depict or reinforce a subjective concept of reality.\u201cQuite a lot of people are sharing AI-generated content, which is clearly fake but is almost seen as a revelatory kind of representation of someone,\u201d Ajder said. This content feeds a mentality that mutters, \u201cWe all know they\u2019re really like this.\u201d\u201cAnd so, even if people know it\u2019s fake,\u201d Ajder said, \u201cthey still see it as kind of reflecting and satisfying a kind of truth \u2014 their truth about what the world is like.\u201dThe lack of subtlety in Trump\u2019s AI images of himself helps explain their consistent virality.Commenters can be found lamenting the demise of presidential decorum (\u201cI never thought I\u2019d see the day when the White House is just a joke. This is so embarrassing.\u201d) or relishing those very reactions (\u201cWatching the left explode over this has been a treat.\u201d).Other responses, even from the president\u2019s base, remain unconvinced (as one X user griped under the White House post of Trump as pope: \u201cI voted for you, but this is weird and creepy. More mass deportations and less of whatever this is.\u201d).But that is tradition for Trump, who finds no trouble cashing the currency of our attention economy: Whether you cracked a smile or clutched your pearls, he still made you look.\u201cIn his first administration, he used Twitter in a way no president had,\u201d said Martha Joynt Kumar, director of the White House Transition Project, an organization that facilitates the transition between presidents. \u201cWhat they do in this administration is taking it further, as you\u2019ve had an increase in what can be done online.\u201d Or, as one Reddit user referred to the president: \u201cTroll in Chief.\u201dDoes Trump really think he should be pope? Does the White House really think him a king? Accuracy isn\u2019t the point, not for a man who frequently arbitrates what counts as truth. Trump's use of AI sticks to a familiar recipe for bait: crude comedy sprinkled with wishful thinking.\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Trump said in May, when asked whether the AI-generated post of him as pope diminished the substance of the official White House account.\u201cHave to have a little fun, don\u2019t you?\u201d![ABC News](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)## Sponsored Content by Taboola## Popular Reads![]( Trump admin live updates: Gov. says 'no need' after Trump directs troops to Portland![]( Sniper opens fire on Dallas ICE facility, killing 1 detainee, wounding 2: DHS![]( 4 dead, 8 injured in Michigan church shooting and fire set by gunman: Police![]( Arrest made after boater opens fire on waterfront bar killing 3, injuring 5### ABC News Live![ABC News Live](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

The [Amazon](/quotes/AMZN/)-backed startup, which is valued at $183 billion, is making Claude Sonnet 4.5 available to all users.Anthropic said Claude Sonnet 4.5 is the \"best coding model in the world\" according to industry benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified, a test set that measures an AI system's software coding abilities.\"People are just noticing with this model, because it's just smarter and more of a colleague, that it's kind of fun to work with it when encountering problems and fixing them,\" Jared Kaplan, Anthropic's co-founder and chief science officer, told CNBC in an interview.The model generates higher-quality code, is better at identifying code improvements and can follow instructions more reliably, the company said.Claude Sonnet 4.5 comes after Anthropic launched Claude Opus 4.1 in August and Claude Sonnet 4 in May. It's the latest example of the breakneck pace of innovation within the AI industry.## Read more CNBC tech news* How a 'nudify' site turned a group of friends into key figures in a fight against AI-generated porn* Trump calls for the firing of Lisa Monaco, Microsoft president of global affairs* Anthropic to triple international workforce in global AI push* OpenAI's historic week has redefined the AI arms race for investors: 'I don't see this as crazy'Anthropic was founded by a group of former OpenAI researchers in 2021, and the two companies have been fierce competitors ever since.OpenAI kick-started the generative artificial intelligence boom following the release of its ChatGPT chatbot in 2022. The startup, which has seen its valuation swell to $500 billion, announced its latest model, GPT-5, in August. The rollout was rocky, as some users complained about losing access to the company's prior models.Mike Krieger, Anthropic's chief product officer, said that Claude Sonnet 4.5 will be the default for users and that Anthropic recommends the model for \"basically every use case.\"Even so, users will have options. Paid subscribers can still choose to use Opus, and users with specific workflows can select an older generation of Sonnet if they aren't ready to migrate overnight, he said. Claude Sonnet 4.5 is smaller than Claude Opus 4.1 but smarter than it in \"almost every single way,\" Krieger added.Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4.5 chatbox.Courtesy of Anthropic\"We have found it, and our customers are finding it, very useful for real, actual work,\" Krieger said.Claude Sonnet 4.5 can run autonomously for 30 hours, and Anthropic said it's able to maintain focus on complex, multistep tasks throughout that period. Claude Opus 4, which the company launched in May, could run autonomously for just seven hours.Anthropic has also been able to improve the model's behavior through extensive safety training, the company said. It has reduced \"concerning behaviors\" like deception, power seeking and sycophancy, which is when a model tells a user what they want to hear.Claude Sonnet 4.5 is also more resistant to prompt injection attacks, where a model can get tricked into doing something malicious, like exposing sensitive data. \"This is the biggest jump in safety that I think we've seen in the last probably year, year and a half,\" Kaplan said.Additional model launches are already on the horizon for Anthropic. Kaplan said better models are coming, including \"very likely Opus.\"\"No promises,\" he said. \"But I think that we'll probably have one or two more releases before the end of the year.\"**WATCH:** Microsoft to buy AI from Anthropic in shift away from OpenAI, sources saywatch nowVIDEO0:4200:42Microsoft to buy AI from Anthropic in shift away from OpenAI, sources sayPower Lunch## More In AI EffectOpenAI announces ChatGPT Instant Checkout for Etsy and ShopifyAshley Capoot7 min agoMicrosoft adds Anthropic AI model to Copilot assistant, diversifying from OpenAIJordan NovetSam Altman on worries about OpenAI's $850 billion in planned buildouts: 'I totally get that'MacKenzie SigalosRead More"

Around one in three workers admit to using shadow AI.Looking ahead, Atlassian says companies should start with laying an AI-ready data foundation to make company data accessible before setting up clear systems and expectations for teams.Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!However, AI use isn\u2019t without its drawbacks, as the report warns, \u201cAI will increase burnout unless we restructure the workday.\u201dWith artificial intelligence removing busywork, employees will spend more time on cognitively demanding work.

                "raw_content": "[Skip to main content](#skip-link-target)Sponsored# The AI tightrope: Balancing government modernization and resident trustPublished Sept. 29, 2025* post* share* post* [print](javascript:window.print())* [email](mailto:?Subject=The%20AI%20tightrope%3A%20Balancing%20government%20modernization%20and%20resident%20trust&Body=https%3A//www.smartcitiesdive.com/spons/the-ai-tightrope-balancing-government-modernization-and-resident-trust/760690/)Sponsored contentBy PayitSPONSORED CONTENT BYState and local governments are accelerating their use of artificial intelligence (AI) to improve public service delivery, but for many residents, that pace feels too fast. While public sector leaders are rightly focused on efficiency, cost savings and user experience, there\u2019s growing concern that public trust and resident comfort are not keeping pace with the technology.This isn\u2019t just a challenge of implementation; it\u2019s a matter of public confidence. And that confidence, according to new data, is more fragile than government leaders might expect.#### **AI implementation is gaining ground \u2014 fast**In recent years, government agencies have made meaningful progress in modernizing resident services. Many basic digital government services are now mainstream, offered by most agencies and embraced by the majority of residents. But in the face of mounting pressures to do more with less, state and local leaders are looking to AI to further accelerate modernization. Artificial intelligence and machine learning rank second on NASCIO\u2019s 2025 State CIO Priority list, behind only cybersecurity. In a survey of state and local government leaders this year, PayIt, the leader in digital customer experience solutions for state and local governments, found nearly 60% of agencies were already using AI in some capacity, whether to automate internal processes, support customer service interactions, or power resident-facing tools like chatbots. Interestingly, only 2% of respondents reported they have no plans to deploy AI. There\u2019s no question: AI in government is here \u2014 and with it comes real potential to improve operations and elevate digital experiences. But it also introduces new public scrutiny, at a time when resident trust is already at historic lows.#### **Residents aren\u2019t as ready as agencies may think**Despite the momentum, only half of residents say they are comfortable with governments using AI to deliver services \u2014 a drop from 56% just a year ago. Notably, net comfort fell among Gen Z and Gen X, but remained generally flat among Millennials and Boomers.This discomfort doesn\u2019t necessarily stem from an outright ignorance or resistance. Most residents are AI-aware, though less than half report using AI regularly (1-2 times a month). But when it comes to government services, concerns about security, fairness, accuracy and transparency take center stage.When asked about potential harms, 87% of residents expressed concern about government AI making decisions based on inaccurate data, 86% about privacy loss and 82% about bias. Nearly 8 in 10 respondents said they believe agencies should be required to disclose when AI is being used in a service.This sentiment aligns with broader trends. A 2025 PEW study found that more than half of Americans feel AI hurts more than it helps when it comes to protecting personal privacy. Only 17% believe AI will have a net positive impact on society in the next 20 years.#### **What does all this mean for governments eager to modernize?**First, they must treat transparency as a priority, not a footnote. Clear, early communication about how AI is used (and what safeguards are in place) can reduce public skepticism. The good news is that resident comfort levels went up when asked about specific AI applications. This suggests agencies should also highlight uses and their benefits, such as reduced wait times or faster issue resolution.Second, overall digital maturity must remain a focus. While AI offers transformational promise, many residents still struggle with foundational digital interactions. Adding high-tech tools before addressing ease of use, accessibility and convenience could backfire \u2014 amplifying frustrations instead of solving them.Finally, agencies should embrace an incremental, resident-first approach. Starting small, piloting AI programs with measurable outcomes and inviting resident feedback at every stage helps build the track record needed to earn trust.#### **Let\u2019s not skip steps in the race toward smarter government**It\u2019s tempting to think of AI as a finish line for digital government, but it\u2019s important not to lose sight of the bigger modernization picture. While residents largely report that online government experiences today are mostly on par with private-sector transactions, actual expectations remain modest. Just around half of consumers anticipate features like transaction histories, payment reminders, or quick checkouts \u2014 features now commonplace in the private sector.Exploring AI\u2019s possibilities can deliver real value, but investing in foundational features and services to improve usability, accessibility and overall experience shouldn\u2019t be ignored. By focusing on transparency, usability and trust, governments can ensure that modernization delivers for everyone.Filed Under:[Tech & Data,](/topic/tech-and-data/) [Public Safety](/topic/public-safety/)### Smart Cities Dive news delivered to your inboxGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts### Editors\u2019 picks* ### [Federal grantees reckon with loss of \u2018generational\u2019 recycling funding under Trump](/news/federal-grants-funding-pause-cancellation-trump-compost-recycling/748850/) The administration has canceled or limited grant awardees\u2019 ability to access federal funding, changing how plastics and organics recyclers view the federal government.
