        "summary": "An article in Fortune magazine draws parallels between the current AI boom and the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, noting massive investments based on potential rather than current profitability and infrastructure overinvestment. While major AI players are generating substantial income, the article questions whether current valuations and infrastructure investments can be justified by near-term returns, as many dot-com companies could not justify their valuations with actual business results. The piece cites rising interest rates and a recession in Japan as triggers for the dot-com crash, as well as flawed business models."

When technologies did have an impact, most were more likely to increase worker numbers than decrease them, with the most common motivation for adopting cloud-based technology, specialized software, and AI being to improve the quality or reliability of processes or methods. Businesses used AI at a higher rate from 2021 to 2022 compared to other technologies, while cloud-based tech, specialized software, and specialized equipment were adopted more from 2016 to 2020."
