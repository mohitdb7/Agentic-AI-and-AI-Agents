The American republic is premised on his worth [...] The chasm was on full display earlier this month as parallel dramas played out at the White House and the Westin Downtown DC just a few blocks away. At the Rose Garden, two dozen tech leaders, representing the richest companies in history, gathered for a private dinner with the president, seeking to outdo one another in flattery. \u201cThank you for being such a pro-business, pro-innovation president. It\u2019s a very refreshing change,\u201d gushed Sam Altman of OpenAI, a sentiment echoed by his rivals at",

Clear, early communication about how AI is used (and what safeguards are in place) can reduce public skepticism. The good news is that resident comfort levels went up when asked about specific AI applications.

While public sector leaders are rightly focused on efficiency, cost savings and user experience, there\u2019s growing concern that public trust and resident comfort are not keeping pace with the technology. [...] Exploring AI\u2019s possibilities can deliver real value, but investing in foundational features and services to improve usability, accessibility and overall experience shouldn\u2019t be ignored.
