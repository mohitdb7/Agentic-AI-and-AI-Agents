Big AI firms have ramped up their lobbying \u2013 OpenAI spent roughly $620,000 on lobbying in the second quarter of this year alone \u2013 in an effort to push back against calls for regulation. OpenAI rival Anthropic meanwhile spent $910,000 on lobbying in Q2, Politico reported, up from $150,000 during the same period last year. [...] Whether or not the AI industry ever truly wanted government oversight is debatable, but what has become clear over the past year is that they are willing to spend exorbitant sums of money to make sure any regulation that does exist happens on their terms. There has been a surge in AI lobbying and political action committees from the industry, with a report last week from the Wall Street Journal that Silicon Valley plans to pour $100m into a network of organizations opposing AI regulation ahead [...] One of the biggest efforts to sway candidates in favor of AI will be a Super Pac called Leading Our Future, which is backed by OpenAI president Greg Brockman and venture capitalist firm Andreessen Horowitz. The group is planning bipartisan spending on candidates and running digital candidates in key states for AI policy including New York, Illinois and California, according to the Wall Street Journal.",
